1k35xwm,AITA for deciding to not go to family events unless I'm personally invited to them?,"So, my dad (46M) and I (18F) have never had the best of relationships. It's very rocky due to the fact a lot of stuff - which I won't get into - happened to me in the past involving him. My parents divorced when I was young due to my dad's behaviour against my mum and my sister and I.

I don't live with my dad anymore due to a lot of things that happened with him and his new wife and see him every now and again. My sister didn't have this arrangement - however now she has moved out and goes to uni so she had seen my dad more often.

Now getting on to the actual part of the story and not just the context.

My dad has never really made an effort to message me unless it concerns my stepmum or little sisters birthdays or events like Christmas - other than that I've always had to message first.

I slowly gave up on messaging my dad as he didn't really care to message me at all. Now we don't message at all unless I text him stuff about what time I'm coming over or just genuinely asking how he is.

A few weeks ago was my family members birthday party I only found this out when I was telling my sister over the phone during our weekly catch up. I was so angry that no one had messaged me about it as I would've loved to see my family member, I haven't seen my dad's side of the family in a very long time. I had no idea there was even a party going on.

My sister said she'd pick me up on the way to our dad's house and I'd go with her before I had work later in the evening.

When I got to my dad's house, my dad was surprised to see me and told me that he told everyone I wasn't going. Keep in mind I have NEVER missed a family gathering as I really love my grandparents and my uncles.

We went to the party and it was fun. I left with my grandad so he could drop me home so I could go to work.

In the car, driving back from work - my sister called me. She explained that my stepmums parents are having a baby shower for my cousin on my stepmums side. When my sister asked them if I'm going my stepmum said I wouldn't be.

I was raging. No one spoke to me about it.

This had never been a trend in the past. I understand where I could be the asshole as I have become a massive busy body recently and I am barely home most of the time so I don't really see him a lot when I am visiting him.

But, the difference between my mum and dad is that my mum will always make plans with me and I'll make plans with her in return.

It's not hard to pick up the phone and ask if I want to do something - whether I'm staying at my dad's or not. It's not like I don't own a car.

It's not like we haven't done stuff together in the past, a while back I planned this trip with my dad. But then again, that was ME making the effort.

It's not like I live an hour away either. About a 15 minute drive from my mums house to my dad's house.

I've decided that if I'm not personally invited then I'm not going, my sister said that was a bit harsh but my mum agrees and so does my boyfriend and a few of my close friends.

1k35tg4,AITA for not accepting a car as a birthday present,"I am 16f. The plan was for my father to get me a new (used) car for my 17th birthday (which is the age you can get a license where i live if you’ve taken drivers education) and i would get a job to pay for the insurance. My parents are divorced and neither are rich but we’re also nowhere close to being poor. My father backed out of getting me a car which i should have expected tbh as he never really follows through with anything. I was of course bummed out a bit about not getting a car, but my dad has agreed to give me 500 dollars to contribute towards the car. With that, my ~1500 in savings bonds, and the 1k i have left from working last summer, I’m in pretty good shape to get a used car within the next few months or even a downpayment on a new car if i start working again and save my money. 

However, my mother has this mini van we got used about 4 years ago. My mom has offered to give this to me but i declined. This may seem greedy of me, but i know this car and i do not want it. It’s in the shop every other month, smells like spoiled milk, and the interior is stained and very dirty (and this is vain, but i honestly just don’t like the model of the car). In my opinion, its more trouble than its worth, and if I’m going to have to pay insurance on a car I’m gonna make sure its something I’m a little more happy with than that junker of a minivan. 

My mom has been trying to really push the car onto me and i really don’t know why. I been getting called greedy and essentially stupid by my mom for not accepting the car and maybe i am? I honestly can’t tell if my expectations are too high or something. I just don’t wanna spend my hard earned money getting insurance and gas for a car I can’t stand, but i could be being a priss about it. And I don’t know if this is a thing everywhere or just where I live, but car insurance is locked in for at least a year, so I can’t just drive the car until i can afford a different one.

1k35plf,AITA for the way I reacted to my dad's outburst?,"I(m16) have to wake up pretty early for school every day and sometimes I don't dress appropriately for the weather. My dad(m58) knows this and a few weeks ago, he let me walk out the door with one of his old mangled jackets. For context, my dad used to work in construction and he's had this jacket for a VERY long time. It's pretty dense and warm despite the wear and tear on the arms.
During school, I left the jacket in my study hall without giving it a second thought, because I usually grab the jackets I take at the end of the day and take them home. 
This day in particular, I had forgotten the jacket and it wasn't a big deal at first. I came home and he asked where it was and I let him know that it would most likely be at school. 
The next day he was incredibly irritated in the morning(that can be usual) and started yelling at me about the jacket and it kind of snowballed into him screaming at me about how I have no regard for others possessions and told me how he was ""mourning the loss"" of his favorite jacket.
We got in the car to go visit my mom in the hospital(a completely different story, but it's related to liver failure and she's been recovering and is ok now), and he just started branching off of the jacket and telling me how selfish I was and how I was always taking advantage of him, which really hurt my feelings. I have pretty bad PTSD(diagnosed) from previous events including my mom's hospital stay, and during that time, I spent almost all my time bed-rotting and sleeping, barely eating and using all my energy to stay afloat in school, and he even yelled at me about how I ""didn't defend"" him while my family was ""attacking"" him(telling him to consider some therapy or counseling). This was all brought up while we were in the car and he was just yelling at me, going in circles about how I take advantage of his kindness and how I should've been there for him.
This wasn't even about the jacket anymore, and I just let him yell. At some point, I started crying and he berated me for being attention seeking and ""trying to make him feel bad"". He told me to respond, to give him the grace of a response and I told him it sounded like his life would be easier without me, and then he started screaming at me about how selfish and childish I am. He stopped the car at some point to yell at me and get me to ""tell him what he could do better"", which really just means ""fuel my fire and give me something to justify so I can yell more"". I ended up just straight up told him he was unstable and that lead to more yelling and we just went to the hospital to see my mom and he acted like the whole ordeal never happend, but he still tells my mom how I'm ungrateful and how I ""sided with the snakenest"".

1k34zqu,AITA for watching one friend's kids but not another?,"Throwaway.

I (30F) have a friend I work with (35F) who was telling me a few weeks ago that she was kind of bummed that her birthday weekend plans had fallen through because her MIL wasn't able to watch her kids anymore. She has three kids, a 12yo and 10 yo twins. I absolutely love this friend so I decided to offer to watch her kids for the day. She was surprised I offered and kept saying it wasn't necessary but I told her I wanted her to have a good birthday. 

The day was exhausting for me but the kids had fun. We went to the zoo and had lunch and I delivered the kids back in one piece. It wasn't something I would do all the time, but I was happy to lend a hand to a friend. 

My friend posted a picture of the three kids that I had sent her from the zoo and tagged me, thanking me for taking the kiddos for the day. Another friend of mine, let’s call her Kelsey saw I was tagged and called me and she was LIVID. Kelsey is a single mom to two young toddlers, 3 and 1.5 yo. She constantly asks me to watch her kids because I live near by. I always decline because to be honest, I’m not a big kid person. I do not like being around young kids because they are so loud and chaotic. I offered with my other friend because her kids were older, house trained, and I’ve met them before. They are quiet and polite. Plus I know this wouldn’t be a regular thing. It was just a one off because of a special occasion. 

Kelsey was so mad that I would watch another person kids but don’t help her out. I told her that it was different circumstances, and that the kids were older and it was a one off. She asks me several times a month. Kelsey said it didn’t matter and I was a horrible friend and a major asshole.",AmItheAsshole,OneAndNotTheOther,759,0.96,155,2025-04-19 20:03:01+00:00,Not the A-hole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k34zqu/aita_for_watching_one_friends_kids_but_not_another/,True,Not the A-hole
1k34i1k,AITA for inviting my boyfriend over to my mother’s every other weekend?,"I (16F) and my boyfriend (18M) are in a long distance relationship. He lives about 2 hours away from me and we are both in school so the only time we can see each other is on the weekends. I live with my father and he had sole custody but my mother got joint custody due to some court issues meaning I have to see her every weekend and do whatever she says. 
Our first weekend was Feb 1st and she discussed some rules to me about my boyfriend. Originally I thought she agreed to him coming over every other weekend because she still wanted some alone time with me which I thought was fair. Every other weekend since Feb 1st he has been allowed to come over. She called me Friday asking about my birthday since it is Wednesday and wanted to know if I need to get my licensed changed and what we were going to do that day. Then she brought up this weekend saying she will pick me up, but this weekend is when my boyfriend is supposed to come up. I brought that up to her and she said why I invited him and that she already made plans. I explained that it has been two weeks since he came down and I thought that what we agreed on but she said she didn’t want him down here every weekend and thought that it was inappropriate for me to see him that often and how she “never” let my brothers see their girlfriends that often. (Which is a lie because their girlfriends went to their school and lived in their town and they worked in a public place making it easy for their girlfriends to visit them all they wanted. Nor was my mom ever home to stop them from leaving. ) 
Well, I said that he had been here every other weekend and so that’s why I thought we agreed on. She said that the only reason it had been like that is because we had events but there were multiple times he came down and there were no events or a reason to come down besides to be with me. And anyways… it’s my birthday… is that not a big enough event to invite him down? Even though my birthday is this Wednesday, right in the middle of the week, I thought she would be more appreciative that I chose this week and not the weekend after because the first weekend of may we had a mini tripped plan and I knew she would not like the idea of him being here two weekends in a row. I tried to be nice and spread it out and I have no other way to see him currently besides just on her time because she decided to steal all my weekends and get mad that I want him over. 

I did record the message on the phone of her saying twice a month not every other weekend. But him coming down this weekend would be two this month.",AmItheAsshole,VisualAdhesiveness94,0,0.3,6,2025-04-19 19:40:25+00:00,Not the A-hole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k34i1k/aita_for_inviting_my_boyfriend_over_to_my_mothers/,True,Not the A-hole
1k345s3,AITA for getting fed up with my nonverbal friend?,"I (19F) have been friends with Andy (19M) ever since third grade. There's a lot of history between us.

Andy has autism, OCD, and intense agoraphobia. He tends to shut down in situations requiring quick critical thinking or conflict negotiation. I’ve never minded that, and I avoid inviting him to crowded places or socially intensive events. The one time he invited me to a convention, it was fun but exhausting. I had to guide him around while he was nonverbal and indecisive.

It wasn’t until we worked together on a time-limited competition that I remembered how frustrating this can be.

Over the three-day event, we were supposed to draft and execute an idea, evenly splitting the work. I kept asking him questions about our ideas and what we should do. He often gave one-sentence answers or went non-verbal for minutes, which built up deep frustration in me.

I brought it up, asking how he felt about the project. He admitted he wasn’t invested and was mostly doing it to make me happy, which confused me since it had originally been his idea. I had asked him if he was okay with it before we began.

I told him he needs to communicate when something bothers him. Partners need to collaborate and compromise. He agreed, and I thought it would be fine.

Then came submission hour. I told him I was submitting our project. He disagreed and asked me to edit a part. I did. Then he asked to edit another part. I said we needed to submit or we’d miss the deadline, but he insisted submission would be quick. I edited again. He asked again. I finally put my foot down and tried to submit 20 minutes before the deadline. Everything went wrong. We didn’t submit on time.

Maybe I should have just trusted my gut, but every time I disagree with Andy, he shuts down. Each time I suggested submitting instead of editing, his tone got upset and he grew quiet. That is the issue. Either he does not say what is bothering him, or when he does, he expects me to go along with it or he gets sulky and withdrawn.

Then he always blames himself, saying he is a terrible person who cannot control his reactions, which drives me insane.

I had to ask for an apology that didn’t include him demeaning himself. I asked him to say what happened and apologize. He said, “What do you want me to say?” and I had to spell it out. “I want an apology where you don’t demean yourself, just say what happened, and actually apologize.”

Now we are here. Avoiding each other. Every time I try to explain my feelings in the most non-accusatory way possible, he just says, “I don’t know what to say.” I know he struggles with conflict, but it feels like I am coaxing a child.

TLDR: My friend will not tell me when he disagrees because he is too afraid, but when he does, he expects me to follow his lead without compromise.",AmItheAsshole,No-Assistant-23,458,0.93,44,2025-04-19 19:24:53+00:00,Not the A-hole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k345s3/aita_for_getting_fed_up_with_my_nonverbal_friend/,True,Not the A-hole
1k33upo,AITA for not paying for a new appliance in a share house,"I (25F) live with 2 roommates, (22M, 26F) and have done for over a year together without issues. Little things here and there, the usual ""can you clean the stove"" vibe but nothing drastic.

I purchased a countertop oven / air fryer before moving in with them in another apartment on my own and it obviously came with me to the new place. I never said no to anyone using it bc I felt guilty with the counter space it took up and it was already in my possession - as long as they kept it clean etc etc.

Fast forward a year and one of my roommates has broken it by putting her dinner in ON THE HIGHEST TEMP, while she went and SHOWERED by overheating it.

At first, I was kinda like ""well things break oh well"" but now they're saying I'm just meant to pay for 1/3 of the replacement. Now usually I'm the type to swallow this and just pay - but I'm also a bit annoyed here bc my appliance has been broken, I'm out the 100 bucks and on the hook for 30 more to replace ... my own appliance.

So AITA for taking an issue, or am I right to ask they replace it 50:50 and I have no share of the new one, when realistically I would argue those that break things should at least a) apologise and b) offer to replace?

Please note, I am weak and I will simply pay for the sake of the friendships and household but want to know everyone's thoughts on whether i am insane to think that they should be offering to cover my share?

EDIT 1: For context for the comments so far, they are both saying it's ""wear and tear"" and not a single instance of overheating that's broken it, hence, the view that we all use it and we all pay for it. If that helps to explain why they are asking me to pay.

1k3112m,AITA for expecting help after surgery?,"Hello good people of reddit. 

So I (F38) had surgery a month ago, where I could not lift anything, get my head down. Slept all day for two weeks before I was functioning again. My DH (M38) had to take care of everything, including getting our child (F6) to school, do all meals, clean ect. His parents was so kind to offer help when they head that I needed surgery, and came by to pick up our daugther from school and cook meals 4 days. We really appreciated the help, both to give my DH a break from doing a double shift, and DD loves them and have a fun time whenever they are here.

My parents also knew I had to get surgery, and my father didn't responed. When I told my mother, she just talked about herself. Two weeks after the surgery, she asked how we juggled it all, when I couldn't do anything and then said that we had to ask if we needed help. And this is where I might be TA. I said that I would never ask for help, because they would never help me even if I asked. 

I know I hurt her feelings, but the truth is that this has been the case for a long time with them.

When I moved out, I was told they couldn't help because it was when my dad wanted to play tennis with his friends. When I had to have surgery last time (knee thing, couldn't walk for 1 week), I could barely finish telling the specifics before they both said that they couldn't pick me up from the hospital to drive me home because they had to work. And the following week they didn't come visit or offered any help. When I gave birth all they wanted was to take pictures of DD to send their friends. No ""how are you feeling"" or ""do you need any help"".

So this time I did not ask for help. I informed them about the surgery two weeks in advanced. Didn't ask for help, and they did not suggest helping by them selves.

  
Every single time I needed anything from them, if it was in working hours or when they might have other plans like sports or so, they would always decline. So I have learned to never ask for help, because the heartbreak from being rejected and put last is too much. 

For me, I always offer help if I see someone struggle, friend or stranger. And I will always go out of my way to help if anyone asks me. I feel gaslighted by my parents, because they say they will help, but history has shown that they wont when I am in need.

So AITA for getting hurt and saying those things to my mother?

1k30vcm,AITA for chosing my gf family over my fathers family on Easter?,"To understand we need a little context. Even before I was born my father had neverending fight with his parents and at one point few years after I was born they cut ties. Now when I'm 20 they realised that they are sick and might die soon so they decided to reconnect with my father (and me and my brother). All I remember about those people is that they treadted my father like trash and he had grown to be not ideal father to say the least.

My father suddenly has a midset that family is always number one, that they have changed and I kinda get why he wanted to join them last Chisrtmas and after few discussions I decided that fine, I will join them for hour or two.
Every single experience I had with them was uncomfortable, i always get comments about my look (I'm kinda into alt style, I'm male with long red hair, painted nails and eyeshadow) and only reason I went is bc I do get along with my cousins and thought I'll do it for them.

After not so chill Christmas I decided to spend Easter with my mom's family which was always the case and then I'll go and join my GF of 2 years with her family, they not a single time disrespected me nor made me feel uncomfortable. Today I told my mum about my plan and she was mad, it turns out that she already had annouced that I will be attending even tho she knew I don't really like to spend time with them

At this point my father's family is bunch of strangers, I don't really need any reconnections especially that uncomfortable and rather spend my few day off work with people that care about me.

My dad will be dissappointed, my mam is already mad and my brother is on their side (it was the same before Christmas), all assume that bc they gave life to my father (who I don't get along either) I should treat them like loving family

I don't wanna fight with them but I also don't want to waste time reconnecting to people who I truly don't care about

Should I go and just sit doing nothing bc they don't even pay attention to me just to make everyone happy that I joined them or should I stand my ground and actually enjoy my Easter?

1k2zg3w,WIBTA if I don't invite my flatmate out to dinners next year?,"I (19M) started university this past year, and have been living with 3 flatmates (Seth 20M, Britt 19F, Casey 18F). We live in a flat that the uni provides for first years, and only share a kitchen. Also for context, I have a lot of anxiety in general, and mainly about whether my friends actually like me or not. I was looking forward to having a fresh start at uni where this would hopefully not be an issue.

The uni doesn't provide accommodation past first year, so housing is a big issue. I was hoping to house with them, but they revealed that they had been looking into housing together without me and had instead invited our other friend (Irv, M18). They said that Seth just did not feel like we bonded enough, and the others just chose him instead of me.

Now I don't blame Seth for this at all. I'm not an idiot, I know why he did this. Everyone else are yappers while I'm more of a talk if I get talked to kinda guy. I need more alone time than others, so I'm in my room a lot more while everyone else hangs in the kitchen. I'm not a big club guy and everyone else is. I know why he said that and I can't say I'd feel differently. I'm not mad, housing with someone is a big commitment and he is allowed to not want to live with me. But I actually feel that I'm pretty close with Casey, Britt, and Irv. Britt has me in her close friends on instagram, which isn't the end all be all but it is a good sign. We've had a lot of great one on one conversations together. Casey told me that she considers me a great friend and doesn't want to lose me. Me and Irv go to movies together a lot. Britt said that if Seth wasn't against it, she'd be down for housing with me. I'm not mad at him, but I am very upset. Like I said, this is my anxiety's worst nightmare and it did affect me pretty badly.

Now that was a while ago and we have kept living together while just kinda ignoring talking about it. Next year is approaching and I do want to continue my friendship with Britt, Casey, and Irv. Yes, they all also contributed (except Irv cause he currently doesn't live with us) but I dunno I don't wanna just end my friendship with them over this. Also I would have gone insane over the past few months living with them if we stopped being friends. I don't want to visit them at their new house, that would just be a constant reminders and trigger (I told them this and they agreed with me), so I want to invite them out to dinners next year. I just don't wanna invite Seth, cause while my friendship with the other 3 has gone on, with him we just kind of exist next to each other. And he is the main source of this whole debacle and is the one who activates my anxiety the most. I doubt he'd notice or mind, and like, if he asked to come I wouldn't say no, I don't hate the guy. But I'd prefer to just invite other 3. Is this bad on principle since they all will be living together and I can imagine it being a little awkward or mean to invite 3/4ths of a household.

1k2yw3c,AITAH about not wanting to host in laws,"AITAH My wife and I have been together for 12 years, married for seven, and have two young kids (6 and 3). Her family—three sisters, their spouses and kids, her parents, and her grandmother—all live within about 90 minutes of us, and our home has become the central gathering spot.

Her grandmother, who’s in her late 80s, can’t travel much but enjoys staying at our place for up to a week. When we host, it’s not just a one-day event—her parents usually stay a night or two, and the whole family comes over for baking, cooking, and full-on holiday traditions. While it’s great for them, the chaos and mess give me serious anxiety. I usually avoid the kitchen and try to stay out of the way, but I don’t think I should feel like a guest in my own home.

I’ve brought this up before, but my wife feels I’m being insensitive—especially since her family is farther away, while mine lives nearby. Somehow, I end up being the bad guy for expressing how I feel.

So, AITAH for telling her that while I get why we host, I don’t want our home to be the go-to spot for every event and that we should find other options",AmItheAsshole,More-Examination380,64,0.88,31,2025-04-19 15:30:36+00:00,Not the A-hole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k2yw3c/aitah_about_not_wanting_to_host_in_laws/,True,Not the A-hole

The first time we split i was the one to move out with the kids. He got me fired from my job and i ended up having to move back in. The next two times he told me to stay and he moved in with his mom instead. But both times after he left he stalked me relentlessly (except for the time he disappeared for four months,) i’d be told almost every day about one of his rants about me in a gas station, at the grocery store, at work, at the playground at the kid of a guy that asked me out once. He broke my window once. Etc. On top of this he’d also tell people i “stole” his house from him, that I’m playing victim, being a deadbeat mother, I don’t deserve the house, etc. 

For context: his mom had a savings account set up for him with $10,000 in it from his dads life insurance. He was supposed to get that money when she died, but she gave it to us to buy our house instead. My credit was bad already(ruined by my parents when i was 18) so the bank wouldn’t let me put my name on the mortgage. BUT in the very beginning of the buying process my husband granted me authority over the entire purchase-meaning, I managed and attended every meeting alone, signed 400+ documents with my own signature, took time out of my own work days to organize appointments between buyer/seller and the inspectors and mortgage officers, etc. We bought under the first-time home owners loan. The whole process took over six months. 

My husband attended the very first meeting in which his mother gave him $10,000 and then we drove to the bank where he signed his approval for me, and the very last meeting 6 months later where he signed his name a second time to accept his home. 

I do not believe he deserves our home any more than i do. Yea, the money we used as the down payment was technically his, and I don’t actually have my name in the title, but as far as actual involvement in the buying process, he had none. He literally just accepted money and then accepted a house. And given the fact that I’m the main parent, i did the work to buy the house, AND he said i could stay, i believe I deserve to stay.

His take is that i “coerced him” into letting me stay, which is why he couldn’t contain his anger about me “stealing” it. I do not agree.

1k2wxts,AITA for still having my friends birthday dinner even though they weren’t there,"I want to start this off by saying I understand how this would be upsetting and completely willing to accept I am in the wrong.

It was my best friends birthday and I had 
 coordinated a birthday dinner with all of our friends. Everyone and including him were aware of the time and confirmed the day before. We all arrived earlier than the stated time so we could be set up with all of our gifts and birthday cake. I expected him to be late, but about 30 minutes after time everyone was looking to me to see where he was. 

So I call him and he sounds like he had just woken up. I ask him what time he would be arriving and he’s like ‘well I was asleep and need to get up and shower so probably around 8.’ Note that it is 5 and he only lives 10 minutes away and as I’m looking around at about 7 other people, I know there’s no way I’m gonna tell them we have to wait 3 hours before we eat especially those who came out of town or had somewhere to be.

 I explained to him and see if it was possible for him to get ready faster, even it took an hour. He basically was like ‘no it’s my birthday but I guess I don’t have to come.’ And that was that. I didn’t know what to say. I explained to the table what had just happened and we all agreed to continue our meal and had the best time. I even got a free meal because they all said it was my birthday. Suffice to say after that our friendship slowly fell off until we didn’t speak anymore. AITA?

1k2wl71,AITA for Canceling Easter?,"My MIL (Susan) and my SIL (Megan, my husband’s brother’s wife) do not get along. Apparently they used to but at some point after having kids, things got strained between them and they’ve had a negative relationship for years.

After a year long battle with breast cancer, Megan’s mom passed away a few months ago. Unexpectedly, her father passed away in the same weekend. It’s been a really hard time for Megan and my BIL and my husband and I have offered to help in anyway we can. Susan was snow birding (vacationing down south during the winter) when the deaths occurred. Even though shes known Megan’s parents for 15+ years, she didn’t come back for the funerals and sent a condolence card a month after the funerals took place. She never called Megan directly, only spoke to my BIL about anything going on and passed messages through him.

Other borderline shady things have happened since the funerals but this is the straw that’s breaking the camels back. Yesterday was grandparents day at my nephews school. They both had expressed they weren’t sure if they even wanted to go to school but since Susan signed up to go, the kids decided they would go to. Megan is a teacher at this school, which is small. Susan didn’t say a word to her the entire day. Megan went to my nephews classroom to check on him and found out Susan had taken both kids home with her thirty minutes prior without saying a word to Megan. Susan taking them was planned but having to find out from your coworker that your children are gone is not something you expect. Megan texted Susan to ask what happened and Susan said Megan was talking to someone else and she didn’t want to bother her so they left. Megan pushed back saying Susan never came over to her classroom and she shouldn’t be taking the kids without telling her. Susan then claimed she was doing Megan a favor so she shouldn’t be upset.

My husband and I are furious with Susan. Not only is she normally annoying with her animosity towards Megan but her parents JUST DIED and this was a tough day, a day her parents would normally have been at the school to see their grandkids. We are supposed to go to Susan’s for Easter tomorrow but I want to cancel. My husband doesn’t think we should get in the middle of it but I’m of the mindset that someone needs to stand up for Megan and put Susan in her place. I truly don’t think she’s going to stop treating Megan poorly until she starts facing some consequences to her actions. There are so many more details I could dump into this to show how crazy Susan is towards Megan but I don’t want to make this any longer than it is. So am i the asshole if i cancel Easter and stand up for Megan? 

One more story: At Christmas, Susan made two lasagnas for dinner, one for Megan’s house, who hosted, and one for the rest of us to eat at Susan’s house. She made us all leave Megan’s at 2pm and go to her house without Megan/BIL/kids so she could have her own Christmas.",AmItheAsshole,Taylagator,2329,0.96,174,2025-04-19 13:44:37+00:00,Not the A-hole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k2wl71/aita_for_canceling_easter/,True,Not the A-hole
1k2wa3z,AITA for ordering a naan at a restaurant,"I (16M) have been dating my partner for a while, and we often go out to an Indian restaurant with their family. My dad is also friendly with my partner’s mum, lets  call her Jane. We’ve been to this restaurant around four times, and I always ask for a naan because the curry texture bothers me.

Recently, we went out for my partner’s great grandma’s birthday. I helped pick out a gift and signed the card. When we got to the restaurant, I asked my partner to ask Jane if she could order me a naan, as usual. Jane gave me a weird look but nodded. When the food came, I wasn’t sure if it had been ordered, so I asked my partner to check with their grandma instead who’s always been kind. 

Not long after, Jane texted my partner calling us selfish, ungrateful, and rude. I was shocked and went to the bathroom to calm down especially since I’ve dealt with trauma from a yelling parent and Jane shouting would’ve triggered me. My partner came to check on me, but Jane suddenly stormed into the bathroom, shouted at both of us, and left. I stayed in there to calm myself.

Their sister came in after and comforted me, agreeing Jane was acting strange. Eventually, the naan was ordered by their grandma and I ate the whole meal, though I felt sick and guilty. Jane didn’t speak to me for the rest of the night. I offered to pay for my food, the naan, anything, just to fix the tension. That night, I stayed over at Jane’s house with my partner but left the next morning because the atmosphere was tense.

I texted the grandma an apology and thanks. Later, Jane texted me saying she overreacted, apologized, and said she felt bad for yelling, especially after hearing it reminded me of my trauma. She said she made my favorite tea and missed me, wanting to move forward with better communication.

I accepted her apology and acknowledged she might be dealing with a lot. A week later, I was invited over again. Things seemed okay, but Jane barely spoke to me. My partner sensed tension too. Over the next month, Jane started making excuses to stop my partner and me from seeing each other. I found out she was saying I’m manipulative and that we spend too much time together, comparing me to my partner’s sister’s toxic ex.

For context, my partner is chronically ill, so I try to visit them a few times a week to help out. My dad helps with driving and even paid part of Jane’s birthday gift. Jane hasn’t been helping much lately. My dad thinks she’s overwhelmed and told me to let it go. I’ve been trying to stay patient, even inviting Jane on walks and outings to include her, especially since she previously had a crush on my dad, which he turned down due to their age gap (10 yr)

I wish I had handled the restaurant situation better maybe paid for myself or calmed down faster but I also feel Jane has been immature. She ignored me all night, called me manipulative, and is now making it difficult to see my partner.

So, AITA? Or is Jane blowing this out of proportion?

1k2v0py,AITA for hanging out with my friends and not telling my other friend?,"My friend ""Pen"" (17F) and I (18F) have two friend groups that were once one. Group 1: me, Pen & her sister ""Ghost"" (18F), and ""Dora"" (18F). Group 2: me, Pen and ""Rainbow"" (17M). Ghost and Dora live an hour away; Rainbow and I live in the city.

The split happened because Rainbow's insulting humor hurts Ghost and Dora, and his reaction is to pick on them more. We separated the groups to keep everyone comfortable.

Rainbow has many college friends we don't know, but it never bothered us that he had his own social life.

Recently, Pen came to my city for two weeks. We planned a day out with Ghost and Dora (shopping, food, karaoke), coinciding with Pen's arrival. Rainbow wasn't invited due to his history with Ghost. He was also busy, and it didn't come up. He knows why he wasn't invited.

We posted a fun karaoke video on TikTok. Within minutes, Rainbow sent a snarky message: ""Don't even. You all have a lovely karaoke and didn't even tell me. Mhm."" I replied, ""Ghost and dora were there,"" hoping he'd understand. He just said ""idgaf"" and left.

Pen messaged him to explain: she'd be in the city, and we'd all hang out later, reiterating why he wasn't invited. He left her on delivered for a day. His reply: the issue was us not telling him. When she tried to explain it was about Ghost's comfort and that he's always out with his own friends without us knowing, he sent a long message and disappeared for another day.

""So that's how it is is it now. Well its not the same now is it. You don't know my friends or have any connection or history with them. I do know 'your friends' and you have a separate group chat excluding me. I'm already alienated from the group but on top of that you decide to have a lovely karaoke and not have the courtesy to explain to me that we will hang out soon as well and not to worry or get fomo but instead let me see you all happily prancing around on my fyp. Makes me feel really included in the group babes x. We must be such good friends.""

We were shocked. He knows Ghost dislikes his humor. He talks about being ""alienated"" despite the separate groups working for everyone's comfort since November.

My mum, who's close to all my friends, talked to him. He said he felt left out, upset we had fun without him, and wanted to be told beforehand and have a future hangout planned so he wouldn't have FOMO. He also said he should've been ""warned"" we were hanging out in ""HIS HOME TOWN"" – a town I have lived in for 12 years! It felt like he was saying I need his permission to have my other friends visit unless I include him. It felt controlling.

My mum brushed off my concerns, saying he's ""going through a lot."" He's now rejoined the group chat, acting normal. We're frustrated that the only adult seems to dismiss his behavior. Now, my mum has invited him for Easter, and we're worried it'll be awkward.

1k2uwum,"AITA for sending my sister some ""backup"" socks to make school mornings less stressful?","My (34) niece (8) has Sensory issues - a main issue being socks and shoes. My sister (26) bought her socks she does not like for starting a new school because she wants her to look a certain way. Niece stated during shopping she will not wear long socks (knee highs). I sent some shorter socks from amazon to my sister as a backup because I know there will be a fight on school mornings and neither of them need that. Anxiety will be high because they've moved school, so why make things harder is my view.
I suggested buying some as a backup during the school shopping trip, but sis said niece will wear what she chooses.
I'm more involved than most uncles because the kids have lived with me part time since 2021 and full time since 2023, with my sister joining us in 2024. They have now all moved to their own flat in a new area after my sister and the girls' dad got back together. I believe the kids should get some choice over what they wear seeing as they are the ones who have to wear it. I don't think kids should be forced to dress a certain way when they dislike it/have issues around clothing.
I've seen the difference between school mornings before sis moved in and after. It was a lot easier, less stressful, and involved far less shouting when the kids' likes/dislikes were honoured. (Not just involving socks, but how they wear their hair, what products were put in their hair, which pieces of the school uniform they preferred etc - sis has given up trying to force oldest to wear summer dresses now which has made things a bit easier).
Also, I have autism and I hated (and still do hate) being forced to do things that make me feel horrible 
 and stressed out, and sometimes this includes doing things most people perceive as ""normal"".

1k2tu77,WIBTA for cancelling a hotel booking I made with people I no longer speak to anymore?,"I (20f) made a hotel booking for myself, my sister (15f) and three other girls (20f) back in October for a concert in June. However, since December, I had an argument with one of the girls that lead to her ignoring me and no longer speaking to me - with the other two seemingly taking her side and the three of them ostracising me from the group. This lead to me moving out of the flat we shared and since then none of them have attempted to contact me and seem to just get angry with me over every little thing I do. I tried multiple times to apologise and amend things with them, which only resulted in them either ignoring me or dismissing the issue as nothing and pretending nothing was wrong.  

That was a very, very shortened summary of what happened, and I've come to the conclusion that I do not want to make amends with these people and do not want to speak to them anytime soon for the way they've treated me. 

Here's the big issue: I do not want to stay at the same hotel as them for this concert in June. The advice I've received from almost everyone in my life is to cancel the booking and rebook another hotel for me and my sister - they think it's an appropriate response to the way they've treated me these past six months.  I don't like this option because I would feel obliged to tell them that I'm cancelling the booking, which undoubtedly start an argument that I'm not mentally prepared to handle. 

It's a refundable, pay on the day booking that can be cancelled up to a week before the stay - I booked two rooms, one for my sister and I and the other for them. My initial plan was to cancel one of the rooms and transfer the booking of the other room to them, however I've been told that my card will still be attached to the booking and that it might not even be possible to do this without talking to any of them about it.

I'm starting now to want to cancel the booking all together and book something else for my sister and I, as I know for a fact they will not sort anything out for themselves or talk to me about this until the very last minute. A lot of people have been telling me I need to grow a backbone and let them deal with the consequences of refusing to comminicate with for over half a year now. WIBTA for doing this?

1k2tnlp,AITA for refusing to give my sister one of the donuts I bought for myself?,"Alright Reddit, need a quick ruling. I'm 22M, my sister is 20F. Still living at home together. I do pay rent FWI

Earlier today, I bought a 6-pack of donuts specifically for myself for $6. Hours ago I ate three, leaving three for later. Just now 10 minutes ago, my sister came in and asked if she could have one of the remaining three. I said no, as I planned to eat them myself.

This immediately started an argument. Our mum got involved and took my sister's side, telling me I should just give her one and that I was being selfish. That such an attitude won't help me out in life. They argued I didn't need six donuts in one sitting anyway and sure for health reasons thats fair but if I want six donuts I'ma get six donuts.

My view is that I bought them for me, with my own money. If she wanted donuts, she was also out today and had the opportunity to buy her own. This happens almost every time I buy these particular donuts, she asks, and if I say no, I get accused of being selfish and made to feel guilty. So sometimes I concede even though I don't want to or say no and get called names etc as has happened again.

Sure, it's just one donut for like $1, but I feel like I should be allowed to eat snacks I bought for myself without being pressured or guilt-tripped. So, AITA for saying no and wanting to keep my remaining donuts for myself?

I guess I should add that she does not eat these donuts or buy them for herself ever. She only ever eats them when I buy them.

Quick edit: We do tend to buy our own groceries and eat our own food, sure sharing does happen but not as much as I imagine it does in other houses. I do also pay rent just to be clear for that one person. If I had to add more I guess any indignation I feel comes less from sharing and not getting the sixth donut for myself, I'm not that hungry for a donut and instead from the huge negative reaction and asshole label that I get for not immediately saying yes. I don't think I'd be so against sharing if I could say no at least once and have that be accepted without a blow up fight. Maybe that does make me an asshole or poor brother though idk.

Edit 2 after reading responses: I appreciate everyone giving their insight, even if they think I'm the asshole, I made the post because I wasn't certain and the reasons many of you have given are certainly one's I can agree with. While I don't fully agree I am in the wrong, and still somewhat struggle to understand how to navigate their reactions to saying no, going forward it wouldn't hurt at all to be more generous / mindful? if that's the right word in asking if she want's some donuts pf her own when I get some for myself. Never really considered a secret food stash either which many have suggested, idk that was such a popular option lol I think I've held onto feelings of resentment at their repeated responses to it for longer than was healthy over such a thing and that I have forgotten that it doesn't hurt to share.

I've always been curious about doing one of these and so seeing the difference in values regarding such a simple topic as sharing a donut has been really interesting.",AmItheAsshole,StubbzyG,419,0.83,353,2025-04-19 10:57:04+00:00,Not the A-hole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k2tnlp/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_sister_one_of_the/,True,Not the A-hole
1k2t6yc,WIBTA if I told my boyfriends best friend that he needs to clean up after himself better.,"For context I 24F have been dating my partner 24M for a little over a year now, and his roommate/best friend 25M, my partner, and myself have been discussing for a little bit now renting a house together in a year or two just to have more space and so we can all potentially relocate. Now my partners best friend who we'll call Kade is a great guy, and he has been an amazing friend to my partner and has been very kind to me. I'm over at their place a lot because my family drives me a little crazy and I just like having the space and privacy since my mom still likes to barge into my room whenever she wants.

Things over there are nice, but Kade is honestly very gross. On his side of the couch there is a sea of empty soda and alcohol cans. Sometimes there will be empty fast food bags as well with empty containers in them. His room also has empty soda cans and the empty holiday soda cups. My partner and I aren't perfect, sometimes we'll forget to take care of our garbage before bed because we're so tired but then we usually get on it the next day before we run errands.

With all of us talking about moving together I've been tempted to tell Kade that if he can't clean up after himself that I don't want to live with him because I grew up in that sort of environment both from my families doing and my own doing because of my depression that I've had since I was a child and I just would rather not live in that kind of environment again because it's embarrassing to bring people over to that kind of mess.

I (20m) have a hand crafted gift for someone in my life which I would like to give to him in private, BUT my grandma really wants to tag along with me so she can gloat about me and how I thought of this gift all by myself and I would much rather I just give this person the gift then fuck off, rather than being embarrassed and harassed by my grandmother. WIBTAH if I told her I wanted to be the only one to go up to him and give him the gift as my mother thinks I’m the AH.
So, AITA?

To add, the gift is hand crafted, entirely by myself, my grandma has nothing to do with it and I’m more than comfortable giving this to the person alone. Also, my grandmother makes me very much uncomfortable with how touchy (physically) and blunt she can be and no matter how many times I tell her to not do something, she’ll still continue to do it. 
Also, the person the gift is for is a priest, I am not a religious person but he’s very lovely and when I get forced into church for family reasons, he isn’t a priest whom makes me want to scoop my eyes out in boredom. 

Edit: Thank you everyone for your support and responses, I’ll let you all know how it goes today.

Edit 2 (what happened): my mother kept insinuating that I’m the AH but I didn’t give a shit, I told my grandma (kindly) that she can come up with me, just to please not praise me and go on and on about me and she agreed- turns out, we got to the church earlier than usual so the priest was at the front organising stuff when he came over to my grandma, whom was in the front row whom pointed to me in the rows behind, and he came over, happy to put a face to the name and I gave him the gift….

1k2sxl2,AITA for not telling my husband how to cook dinner?,"My husband (28M) and I (27F) met in 2023 and got married pretty quickly. He works week on/week off in a port and before I got pregnant I was a sommelier working mostly nights. Most of our relationship has been pretty traditional, with me taking care of the house, garden, chickens, pets, cooking dinner every night, etc. A lot of that is based on the fact that I can’t go back to my job until we’re done having kids and isn’t really based in any toxic gender roles. We both wanted to have kids right away and I appreciate him working so hard to make that happen. 

12 weeks ago our son was born and had to stay in the NICU for ten days. His health complications were totally unexpected and we only recently received an actual diagnosis of a rare metabolic disorder. Having a special needs newborn was something neither of us were prepared for. It’s been especially hard on me during the weeks he is 
away at work. 

I have ADHD and being sleep deprived and in a spiral of malnourishment has not helped lol. Usually by the time he goes down for the night I just feel like cooking or even eating a few bites will be the sensory experience that puts me in a full blown mental breakdown. I’ve tried explaining this to my husband but idk if he really understands. Every night without fail he asks me what I’m making for dinner and I tell him nothing, I’m going to bed. I don’t understand why he hasn’t figured out that I’m not cooking him dinner anymore.

His solution to this has recently been to cook for himself. But he does this really obnoxious thing where he comes into our room and asks me how to do every single cooking step as I’m trying to fall asleep. It started with things like “How do I bake chicken breasts?” And I’d tell him to google it. He now is using the excuse that “it’s so good when you make it, I want to maize it just like yours” when I tell him to find his own recipe or meal inspiration.

I will admit that I really started to scream at him on Tuesday night. I completely lost it. He asked me how I make cilantro rice and I told him to chop up cilantro and put it in rice.

For the last couple of years, he’s been wanting to buy a house. I’ve always supported that and told him that when the time came, I’d find somewhere else to live. About three weeks ago, he had an offer accepted on a property, but hasn’t been given a completion date yet.

Here’s the issue: our current landlord wants the property back by September. That means we need to give notice in the next couple of months, and I don’t want to be caught out with nowhere to go. I’m also ready for a change and don’t really want to stay in this property any longer than I have to. Renting feels precarious enough, and I’d like to find something stable for myself.

I’ve told my housemate that I have a viewing for a new rental next week. It’s available immediately, and I’m seriously considering taking it if it’s a good fit. He told me that this has really stressed him out and he’s terrified he’ll end up homeless if I move out before his sale completes.

We’re both on the same tenancy agreement, which we can end with one month’s notice. I’ve even offered to let him lodge at my new place temporarily if needed, but he’s not comfortable with that.

1k35wh6,AITAH for saying “please tell me that is not my Stromboli” when I walked back into my house.,"AITAH…my SD stayed up really late last night so she woke up and then fell asleep on the couch in the living room…already I’m annoyed because I have stuff to do and I have no space to work (laundry always gets folded in living room) so I said forget it and decided to go to my neighbors house for a kids b-day party. I was at my neighbor’s house for their kids 1st birth day. SD 11 was home solo I assumed dad would be home before long. She’s capable of making sandwiches etc. but she didn’t.

I got back home at 3 and walked in to smell a pizza smell and see what looked suspiciously like MY Stromboli that I bought for ME on a plate and I said something. And her dad said “well she had to eat something. But there was still a personal sized deep dish cheese pizza in the freezer she COULD have had instead but they said they didn’t see it. 

Now he’s pissed that I said something and I’m pissed that yet again the kids ate something that was mine without asking me. Yes this is an ongoing issue of things I purchase for my enjoyment being eaten before I can enjoy them.

1k3408y,AITA for wanting my spouse and I to go to bed together?,"Recently my wife and I got into a big fight because I came out to the living room at 2:30am, asking her if she could come to bed with me. 
She got really mad at me and lashed out saying I was being really controlling because I’m constantly rushing her to come to bed with me. 
For context: an hour earlier I went to bed and asked if she could come to bed soon and she said, “yeah, right after I finish eating my dinner” and an hour goes by and I come back out and we got into a fight. (i was kinda irritated because I was waiting up for her)

1k30ucr,AITA for repeatedly asking my partner if they’ve sent money to a friend?,"Friday, I (M21) asked my bf (26) to send money to our friend/housemate A. He owes friend A a small chunk of money, and he owes me quite a bit for a large-ish recent purchase that we made (tcg cards).

A asked me prior to see if my bf had sent me money for his split of the purchase yet, I said no. We worked out a plan where bf would send me 100 every week when pay came in. Because I understand that things are hard and he has other things to work through.
A (who is recently employed) has told me his savings are low, and since he pays rent monthly, he wanted to ask if bf has sent the money to me yet. I answered no, and said that I would ask my bf to send him first so A could work on saving for rent. (A has savings but was previously unemployed for 3-ish months. He’s been living on his savings for a bit now.)

I then asked my bf to send money to A first and pay A back, as I have savings (for the time being) and I was worried about A’s financial situation. This was on Friday

Bf asked me why I asked him to send money to A, and I said that A might be struggling with rent, as well as A’s family was moving. and that since A isn’t very confrontational, they might be hesitant to bring up paying them back. Bf then said that A had a job and got paid recently so A should be alright, but I still told him to send A the money first just in case. I then left it because I assumed he had went to send the money. 

Early noon today, I asked bf again if he had sent A money. He said no, so I asked him to please do so.

After a while (4/5pm) I asked if bf had sent A money. He said not yet, but that he would.

Around dinner time (7-8pm) I asked him again. He said not yet, but told me to drop it. I said okay.

We were up playing games and doing our own stuff, so when I saw him in the living room I asked him if he had sent the money. He snapped at me to “stop”. He sounded very annoyed and his tone shocked me. I dropped it and came to the room to type this up.

I don’t really know what to do, but I’m getting really tired of pestering him, as well as feeling quite upset that he snapped at me. 

I’m upset mainly because he was meant to send me the 100 anyways since he was supposed to pay me 100 everytime he got paid. I just asked him to send it to A as he seemed to need it more than I do at the moment. (Bf owes us both money)
I don’t understand why he was so annoyed at me, it’s not that hard to transfer someone money. It just feels like he doesn’t want to pay friend A back.
Because of this I’m now annoyed and in a bad mood as he owes me 550 for his split of the purchase we made. I only offered to pay for him so he can pay me back slowly because I knew he had a lot on his plate (got a new car battery recently, had to deal with registration and stuff). 

Was I wrong to have repeatedly pester him about it?",AmItheAsshole,sufferimgs,4,0.65,12,2025-04-19 16:57:42+00:00,Asshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k30ucr/aita_for_repeatedly_asking_my_partner_if_theyve/,True,Asshole

In the short span of a year I have put about 200 hours into playing video games and have got a reasonable amount better at all of them and fallen in love with them even more, while most of the other things that I do at anywhere don't spark my interest nearly as much. My dream is to go pro and stream on some streaming service and make a living from that because that what I love, but my parents are shutting that passion down because they think that it is a stupid hobby and you can't make any money from it. I am contemplating quitting school and putting in work to make good quality content with many good video ideas in mind, I will not just sit back and game all day but actually learn how to edit and get better at the games I might even get a coach. what do I do and how do I get it to through to them that it is not a waste of time or just a hobby but a way to make a living, and what do you think of my situation from a third person perspective and am I in the right or just delusional, for trading my education for my passion?

I (21F) had enough after a good while and with my sibling (30) sitting across the table I started laughing really loudly.

1k2ow1g,AITA for not helping around the house more because I'm not home for 11(+) hours each day,"okay so, abit of context. 

I work basically an hour from home, and it's a 9 hour shift (10-7). I wake up at 7, take an hour to actually wake up, then get myself ready, leave by 8:45. get to work at 9:45 and then I work until 7. HOWEVER because I can't leave until all customers are gone, so many times I don't leave until 8 or even 9, so I'm getting back home late (usually 9 or 10). (think 60-80 hrs/week) it just feels like--wake up, go to work, eat lunch at some point, come home, sleep, repeat (and no I don't eat regularly because I can't make a routine to save my life, I'm just shy of 6 feet tall and bounce between 110-140lbs monthly because I forget to eat)

anyways-

I (23F) live with my mom who is a self-employed/freelance hairstylist (idk the proper word for it but she's an independent stylist, doesn't work for a company or anything). and while I understand she is getting older (42F), she works literally not even 10 minutes away from home, and is almost never fully booked with clients every day (wonderful stylist, not dissing her ability, but the most clients she sees in a week is around maybe 10-15) so she spends a lot of time at home when she's free.

the AITA part comes in when she yells at me for not doing more around the house, half of which is things I'm too tired to notice, or things I didn't make a mess of

1k2opoa,AITA or am I a loser who gives in to peer pressure?,"Hi everyone, I and my wife have been hanging out with another couple for almost a year, we work 9 to 5 jobs, we’re comfortable but not rolling in it. They both do well in their careers which are more lucrative than ours, also have a huge financial backing from their families. I can say they're in a different league.  

At first, they looked like down-to-earth people and were willing to share their knowledge about every aspect and even helped us many times, we didn’t feel any barrier. My wife and I are sincere and no-nonsense people, we’re humble and always up for learning from someone we think is better than us, for us, this has been a real win. 

But over time, we started to notice they weren't as chill as we first thought, it gradually went from them just sharing their unbiased thoughts to them insisting they knew exactly what's good for us and whatnots, like they know for sure what we'll end up with if we go down that path. We amen to anything they said, but they weren't so much with us, it’s like many things we did – buying that car, renting that place – was a bad move in their eyes. 

Besides us slowly not seeing eye to eye, things got weird when we randomly talked to someone pretty close to them. This person, who we practically never hang with, seemed to know pretty much about us, like how frugal we are and act sympathetic, we felt like we were being looked down on. 

We also began to see they treat everyone else way differently. Apart from how they are with us as I mentioned above, they're constantly buttering up their other friends, especially if those friends are richer or more successful than them in their jobs. 

Maybe the reason they act like that is because we're always so sincere in appreciating them and showing how much we look up to them and not drawing a line which makes them think we're not on their level. Or maybe they're genuinely decent folks deep down who just have low EQ. Or maybe we're probably just being naive in believing that friendship isn’t always about money and status. 

We totally see why it makes sense to hang with people who are on a higher status than us and swallow our pride to learn from them, even if they're not always the nicest people, sticking with people like us might mean we don't ever move forward. 

We stopped talking to them as soon as we figured that out, we are matured enough to realize it wasn't about peer pressure (not sure about this) but what we actually wanted, we're at that point where we know when enough is enough, you know. 

I'd really like to hear your thoughts on this. Thank you and sorry for the long vent. ",AmItheAsshole,Sure-Pangolin6121,2,0.56,15,2025-04-19 05:05:44+00:00,Asshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k2opoa/aita_or_am_i_a_loser_who_gives_in_to_peer_pressure/,True,Asshole

1k2mw2k,AITA for not letting my friend back into a groupchat?,"So my friends created a group chat of about 8 people, and one of them got kicked because she was racist, she asked me to be added back but I didn't. For context, Lily is Indian, Marcus, Mia and I are white. Alex and Jenna are Asian. I changed their names for privacy reasons.

Lily: Sent a picture of nachos.

Marcus: curry.

Lily: Of course U think everything is curry cause every seasoning is the same to u.

Jenna: Cause they're white.

Mia: It's not because we are white, he's just making a racist joke which btw is not funny Marcus.

Jenna: Yeah and I'm making a racist joke too. Literally what?? You'll live, white chick!

Alex: SOME ok SOME white people get mad at racist jokes which isn’t targeted towards them and think they have to speak up about for no reason. Just let that person figure it out if they find it funny or not then you can come and rescue.

Jenna: Was directed to a whole other person too like what. White chicks are crazy as Hell.

(Jenna and I also made some jokes about colonisation, but everyone thought it was funny except Mia)
Mia left the group chat.

A few days later she asked to be added back.
I did a poll in the groupchat, to see if she should be added back. Lily voted yes, Jenna, Alex, and Marcus voted no.
Jenna told me to send a message, but it was very harsh so I edited it. 
I sent this instead and checked with everyone in the groupchat:  So, one of the examples is when people made colonising jokes. you made it a personal attack, which sparked a few arguments. They also think that when you left the group, it did temporarily diffuse the situation but it didn't help at all, and that you should have been held accountable instead of ignoring it.
There's also the fact that as a white person, there are a lot of privileges you have, and it kinda felt like you were victimising white people and brushing off minorities, and it feels like white supremacy, and that you're painting them as insensitive.
But it generally isn't about racism, it's just that a lot of arguments, specifically the ones with Chris got dragged on for longer then they should have, and people who shouldn't of been in those arguments got pulled in as. Also how dragging around arguments just tires everyone out, and it's exhausting to be around and deal with.

Mia replied to me, complaining about how she's been bullied since kindergarten, and that her life is so messed up.

Some other information is that the gc doesn't rly talk outside the gc, and at school Mia usually hangs out with people outside the gc. Jenna, Alex, Lily and I often hang out. Jenna and Alex were never really friends with Mia to start with, but there always was a bit of tension between them.

Usually it’s never a big deal, I just ask them to repeat it we laugh about it, and that’s it.

1k2k8pw,WIBTA If I skip out on a friend's birthday to watch a hockey game,"So to give more context. I am a hockey fan, but specifically a fan of the Ottawa Senators. And for those who know the NHL, you'd know it's been a particularly rough time for Sens fans the past near decade or so.

For those unaware, the Senators last made the playoffs in 2017, which is when I was 16 years old. I am now 24 years old and throughout that time I was (and still am) and huge hockey/Senators fan. This year will be the first time they're in the playoffs since 2017.

The birthday plans are for the 26th, which would be game 4 of the series. The game is from 7-9:45\~pm and the plans are as such: drinks at a bar at 7:30 then a dinner reservation for 8:30.

It's about an hour and 20 minute commute for me to get to the bar as I live out of the city's downtown. I've considered not going to the bar and getting to the restaurant late, but unless I left a bit after the first period I wouldn't get there until the plans were almost done, so I'm unsure if this is feasible. I don't have a reliable method other than sailing the high seas in terms of watching the game on my phone, which is frustrating but half workable at best.

WIBTA if I didn't go to her birthday plans for this? This means so much to me and I'd hate to have to miss it, but I also understand that it is ""just sports"" when it comes down to it. My friend knows I'm a hockey fan, but not really the extent of it as none of the people in this friend group are into hockey so it doesn't come up too often so I think saying I won't be coming out because of the game would seem valid to her.

1k2gmmq,WIBTA for not keeping a promise to my friend?,"this is gonna sound pathetic but here we are 😭


My (f18) family is selling my family house in my home country so for the past week or so i’ve been staying in it to sort my old things and leave the house empty for the new owner. I haven’t lived in this house for almost 6 years now so looking thru my old toys was really bittersweet for me. 


My friend (m18) is absolutely obssesed with monster high dolls and petshop figurines. I was too as a child, and so I promised him that I would bring him the ones that I’ll find, since I would prolly throw them out anyway. And here is where the issue comes.


I did not realise how emotional looking and those toys would be, so many memories -ones that I didn’t even realise I had- unlocked while looking thru those dusty boxes. I was in pretty sure I would find dozens and dozens of those toys but I was wrong. I found one knock-off monster high doll, and 5 petshops, from which one is also a knockoff. 


I sent the photo of the doll to my friend saying I will bring it to him but he laughed at me asking wtf even is that toy and that he can see it’s not one of the original monster high dolls. I didn’t even know that, I was pretty poor growing up and I really do cherish everything I (used to) own. It made me pretty sad, but i kept searching and then I have found the figurines. I sent the pics of them to him and told him i can bring them to him if he will „treat them good”, but now im having second thoughts. 

It feels like im giving away my memories, the house being sold is pretty harsh on me, i kind of feel like i wanna preserve every thing form this house, including my last figurines. Would i be the asshole for pretending to idk loose them or forget about them?

Very nice guy and well liked personally, but people seem very confused by what he does or how effective he is at the job. 1. He and our boss do not get along. 2. He has openly and consistently said to several members of our team how unhappy he is and makes open jokes about how he wishes they would fire him and how he doesn't want to be there, etc. 

Also, a few months into the job, I think our boss told him something to the effect of she didn't want to hire him and yet, he has chosen to stay somewhere where all signs point to him not belonging, not having a real portfolio to work on, etc. And again, he himself has not been happy -- but again, he refuses to quit and look for a workplace where he will feel happy and fulfilled. 

Joe and I are friendly in the office and we definitely talk a few times a week and have a friend-like relationship, but I do not consider him a friend. We do not hang out outside of the office. He does, on the other hand, consider me a friend. 

Recently, I was chatting with another coworker about general feelings about the team. And I shared with this coworker that I thought Joe should probably have been let go a long time ago. And I told this coworker that I had shared this sentiment with our shared boss because she ASKED ME for my honest opinion. I was NOT proactively campaigning behind his back for him to lose his job. I was asked for my personal opinion, and shared it with a ""business"" hat on, not a ""friend"" hat. 

I think it's also important to share in the past, I have encouraged Joe to seek employment elsewhere so he can be happier because I genuinely do want the best for him. So I have implicitly said to him I don't think he's at the right place and since he won't quit, I think he should probably just wait to be let go. And he more or less agreed. 

Well, it got back to Joe from the coworker I spoke to that I had shared my opinion with our boss. He is now upset with me and feels that I betrayed him. He mentioned that I jeopardized his career when in reality, I know multiple other people feel the exact same way I do and have shared this same opinion with our boss. So I am not the only one.  

I apologized that I hurt him and I completely understand how he feels. But from my POV, I was asked for an opinion, I shared it honestly because I was asked, and my real mistake was sharing trusted information to another coworker who obviously cannot be trusted.

1k294x5,AITA for not letting my dog inside?,"So for a bit of a backstory, I 17F have a rescue dog that's a 3yr beagle mix. He often times runs up the road when I let him outside alone. I recently got him a harness and a chain to put outside. The chain is long enough that, in the middle of the yard, he can reach the porch to scratch on the door. I let him in when he scratches and he's only out for an average of an hour or an hour and a half with water accessable. Recently he's started crying while being chained up. He doesn't want inside or he'd come to the porch and scratch at the door, he just wants off the chain. 

Yesterday animal control showed up at my house and I asked what was happening and they said my neighbor called for an animal wellness check claiming I'm neglecting him and refused to let him inside (I let him out roughly 20 mins before). I explained the situation they left. I figured out who it was quite easily. I went over and asked if she knew who called, I didn't want to be direct. She has no shame saying she called to get him re-homed because I'm ""neglecting him"". I asked why she thought that and she said it's because he's been crying for twenty minutes. I explained he just wants to run up the road and she said I'm lying and just don't want him in the house. She insisted I took him inside in this heat, my phone said it was 60-70⁰f at the time, because it's too hot for him to be outside. Again, I explained if he wanted inside he would make it be known and would scratch. She then said I'm depriving him because he has nothing to play with. The spoiled dog has a bucket of toys beside the tree and there's plenty of sticks to play with, not to mention my cat runs around with him when I take her for her daily walks (yes I walk the cat leash and all). I make sure he always has something to play with but she keeps insisting on letting him in. She even said I should get another dog for him to play with and that was the point I snapped and told her to fk off. Aita for how I handled the situation? 

Edit: I forgot to mention why exactly I got mad at her words. Last month my dog, a beautiful pitbull mix passed away and everyone in the neighborhood is aware. The way she worded it was she wanted me to simply replace my and my dog's best friend. He grew up with the pitbull, both of us lost someone important and he still won't even lay on his brother's bed. He even refused to eat when I tried to move his brother's food bowl a week ago so I feel like he's still struggling as much as I am and her words made me feel like she was saying to replace him. 

I do walk him and when he's out it's not always on the chain. He's only on it when I can't constantly be watching him. I'm currently trying to arrange a situation where my cousin will bring her dog to play so he's not as bored, we have a playdate set up for tomorrow. Also working on a fence situation so he won't be chained. 

Update: Animal control showed up again and did a welfare check and found nothing wrong and left. It was the same man from yesterday, he seemed a bit annoyed at being called back.

Most people find me TA, if you do suggestions on what I should do are helpful. ",AmItheAsshole,Girraffe801,0,0.42,108,2025-04-18 16:29:25+00:00,Asshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k294x5/aita_for_not_letting_my_dog_inside/,True,Asshole
1k26xus,AITA for not helping clean up after the weekend trip because I didn’t make any mess?,"I went on a weekend trip with a group of friends and we rented a cabin together. I was super mindful the whole time, cleaned up after myself, did my own dishes, didn’t spill anything or leave stuff lying around. But some of the others weren’t as careful. On the last day, everyone started cleaning the whole place together, even the shared spaces, and I kind of just… didn’t. I figured since I didn’t contribute to the mess, I shouldn’t have to help clean it up. A couple of people gave me weird looks, and later one of my friends texted saying it wasn’t cool that I just sat around while everyone else pitched in.

1k1xwzz,AITAH for moving in with my boyfriend at the end of me and my best friends lease?,"*edit* common question “Why don’t you add your boyfriend to the lease?” My friend does not want to add him to the lease because he doesn’t like his dog and doesn’t want to live with a couple. For added context, my friend and I share a 4 bed 2 bath house. I have offered to split rent in a way that my boyfriend and I pay 200 extra monthly. My friend rarely cooks and all appliances/pots/pans/silverware were bought by me. As me and my boyfriend would share 2 out of 4 bedrooms, I have explained to my roommate that to minimize living room time we would get a couch and tv for my office to have a separate place to relax. 

*edit* My roommate and I’s lifestyles no longer mesh. He lives a more party lifestyle. While I enjoy having a drink a couple nights a week, it’s gotten to a point where this is expected nearly every day and I am often asked repeatedly/dubbed the bad guy if I don’t want to hangout and smoke/drink. 

Me (24 F) and my best friend (25 M) have been friends since freshman year of high school, so around 10 years... We moved from our home town on the east coast to a big city on the west coast in July of 2021. For almost 4 years, we've been each others only familiar faces in this new city and have a sibling like bond.
Over the last few years, we've become more established in our careers and moved from our original apartment into a bigger house (same city) in September 2024. We signed a 12 month lease that is up in September 2025. Neither of us have ever had issues keeping a job or paying bills - Most of our disagreements are typical roommate/friend stuff.


Me and my boyfriend (22 M) met at work in 2023 and started dating November 2024. My boyfriend wants me and him to get a place together when my lease is up this September. I really want this too. The only problem, is when my friend and I moved into this house (a couple months before I started dating my boyfriend) we verbally agreed that we would renew our lease and spend 2 years in the house. I have floated the idea to my friend about moving in with my boyfriend when our lease is up this year and he says that he has trips planned, other commitments, etc. and isn't in the place to live alone come September 2025... Am I the asshole for going back on the original plan of staying for 2 years in this house? Is 4 months adequate notice that I wouldn't be renewing?",AmItheAsshole,Sufficient-Dot2759,36,0.75,67,2025-04-18 06:03:24+00:00,Asshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k1xwzz/aitah_for_moving_in_with_my_boyfriend_at_the_end/,True,Asshole

1k1nb3m,AITA My (36M) gf (34F) blew up our bedroom with stinky farts and I lost it.,"The title says it all. My gf has been having these terrible bouts of putrid farts. The smell is extremely strong and it can linger for hours. She has been dealing with this for a few weeks and she is going to see the doctor about it soon. 

Each time she has these spells, she lays in the bed and blow up the room. The farts are so stinky and strong, you can smell them in the hallway before you get to our room. They are so bad, I get physically ill when I smell them. 

Last night I tried to go to bed early and when I went to lay down I was hit with a putrid smell of farts. It filled the entire room. I tried to play it off and I told her she smells like rotten hogmogs.

She laughed but that just made me angry. I was already trying to cope with a joke but I didn’t think it would trigger me like that. To my defense, there have been nights where I could not go to sleep because the smell was so bad. 

Last night was the last straw. I wasn’t upset about the gas because she can’t help it, but I was upset about the fact that she chose to lay there and blow up the room knowing I have to sleep in there too. She could have slept on the couch and would have been fine. I cannot physically sleep on the couch without a lot of discomfort. She has slept on the couch before with no issues. 

I basically called her inconsiderate and nasty. I also said she smell like turtle tank and how she needs to take her funky ass to the couch so I can get some sleep. I also said how I basically come home from work, clean, cook, and I’m exhausted at the end of the day. All I wanted to do was sleep but I have to deal with this funky ass smell. 

I told her she is not the only one that has to sleep in here. I tried to lay down but she just kept farting!! At this point the sheets and blanket smelled like straight up death.

I got up and went in the front room to try to sleep. I couldn’t sleep because I could smell it from the living room!! Now I have to go home and wash the damn sheets because she won’t do it. AITA? Should I apologize for saying those mean things to her? I feel bad but then again, my feelings are valid. She was dead wrong for blowing up the bedroom like that.

1k1jznl,"WIBTA for saying if my brother wants to attend my wedding, he can reach out to me?","I (29F) am getting married in August. I have a younger brother (28M) with whom I used to be close, but our relationship has deteriorated in recent years, culminating in us not speaking for over two years now.

My relationship with my brother started to get rocky 7 years ago when I graduated from college. We lived together and we argued all the time: from my side, we argued about things that I found inconsiderate or disrespectful, and he usually told me I was in the wrong for feeling that way (e.g., one weekend I was out of town and came home to find that my bed was stained + several of the snacks I paid for separately/kept in my room were missing. My brother said he’d let a friend sleep in my room and he ate my food; when I was angry he'd done this, he claimed I only ever got angry with him over material things and said I'm selfish. On his end, he would get upset with me if I went out with my friends and didn’t include him (even if he’d previously said he didn’t like them) and would tell me that I was unempathetic because he had been struggling with depression and I wasn’t supportive enough (for example by not including him)). 

Things took a real turn when I decided to stop living with him 4 years ago. I moved in with my boyfriend (now fiancé) to a different state. My brother never finished college, and he has worked for a sum total of 3 of the past 10 years. My parents paid his rent for 10 years and still do now. My parents graciously paid in full for me to go to college, and he was offered the same fully paid for. For a 6-month period 3 years ago, my mother wouldn’t allow my brother to re-sign the lease on his 2-bedroom apartment (only one bedroom was occupied because he could never find a roommate) and he moved into her house where she paid for his food and gave him a small allowance. Around then, I was working hard to get promoted at my job, had just moved in with someone for the first time and was navigating starting a life in a new city. Almost every time I spoke with my brother he was upset with me that I was not showing enough empathy for his situation and wasn’t being supportive enough. 

I apologized sincerely and tried to do better. I would call and check in on him, and he even came to visit me in my new city once. The visit was not great for me; I paid for everything the whole weekend (we went out to multiple dinners, etc.) and barely got a thank you. This wasn't enough according to him, and after enough times of him yelling at me and berating me, and me apologizing, I just decided to stop reaching out to him. 

That was 2 years ago, and we haven't spoken since or seen each other (except for one family visit, where he rolled his eyes at me as soon as I walked in the door which set the tone for the whole visit). My family is pressuring me to invite him to my wedding, even though we haven't spoken and frankly, I don't want him there, and neither does my fiance.

1k1dv4c,WIBTAH if I buy Christmas gifts for myself and give them to my mom to give to me?,"Hello, I(18m) have been noticing during Christmas and birthdays that my mom(46f) isn't great with getting gifts for me and she gets bothered when I'm not enthusiastic about what she does get. 

Are the gifts God awful? No. Does she know what she is getting me? No not really. 

Simply put: my mother is lost on what to get me even when I give her a list and is a tad peeved when I don't react all too strongly to her gifts most of the time. 

Last Christmas she was dealing with the only gift of hers I actually responded to strongly being an ""I owe you"" for a Manga box set I asked for. 

The rest of the gifts weren't bad but I'll explain what they were and my lack of reaction:

Bluetooth headphones: I don't feel comfortable receiving new tech when I don't ask for it, especially when I have a perfectly fine and usable one already. My reaction was awkward blank faced stare(my sisters got a pair each too. The pair is unopened in lying in my closet)

Scratch notes: I was pretty intrigued, however, I didn't care for them. They're fine, but scratch notes aren't a thing a then 17 year old would care for. (I used some but most of the box is still full) 

Christmas themed sticker sheets: I like stickers, but most were Christmas themed and some were puffy stickers. I don't like puffy stickers and don't used them. 

A pack of fineliners: makes sense since I'm an artist. Problem? I don't use fineliners, I use ballpoint pens. The fineliners I regifted. 

To say the least she was a bit peeved by the lukewarm reception and looked jealous when I responded happily to my aunt's gift of a book of an author I like.

I am a big gift giving type, so it sorta hurt me how she seemed so wounded that she didn't get much of a happy reaction out of me from her gifts.

So now I am thinking of how to prevent the same since last year she couldn't manage to get any of the 4 things I asked for on time or at all. (doesn't bother me much tbh just was a bit eh) I thought a simple one: buy gifts for myself and give them to her to gift them to me again so she enjoys giving the gift and gets a happy reaction from me. 

Though I am also remembering that might be passive aggressive to do. Like ""you suck at gift giving so I am doing it for you!"" and all that.

1k1dfwt,AITA for asking a girl her age at her own birthday?,"
I recently went to a birthday party for girl who is friends with someone close to me. 

I drove and 5 people came with. All whom know the birthday girl pretty well.

I however do not know her or anyone else attending the party and I dont even like socializing with people I do not know but my good friend wanted to go and me driving her and her friends there would really help them out. 

After about a hour of being there I ended up at a point where I was talking to the birthday girl. Keep in mind at this point I mainly was by myself the entire time or with someone I came with.

I had no clue what to talk to this person about so I asked her how old she was turning. You know, becuase its her birthday that day.She then said that it's rude to ask a woman her age, Im thinking she's like 33-36, and she seemed irritated i asked her.

Confused by this i asked her why it's rude to ask her how old she is and she said that asking is insensitive and rude.

As someone who speaks their mind i said I thought it was stupid I couldn't ask someone their age at their own birthday party.

She proceeds to get angry with me and emotional and says something along the lines that I'm disrespecting her in her own house at her own birthday party.

I suggested she was over reacting and at this point her white knight of a boyfriend is involved and trying to be tough with me. Which i found very funny and kinda sad.

So I decided fuck this person and fuck this party. Told my close friend I don't feel comfortable being there no more and I'm leaving.

After a bit of arguing about what happened and the fact I'm the DD for 5 other people who didn't drive there I was told to just wait in the car. I told my friend I'm leaving and anyone who wants to leave the way they came needs to come with me at that moment. 

Seeing those other 4 people are now involved becuase they were told im leaving the entire party becomes involved which makes me really not want to be there.

Two stayed but the other 3, some who were tipsy, rode home with me. The whole ride home they pretty much ignored me.

I got a text after I dropped off my close friend about how I ruined the party for her and the birthday girl and I'm a selfish asshole.

Tldr; i asked a girl her age at her birthday party. She got upset and I wanted to leave but if I did the people who came with me would also have to leave or find another way home.

1k1c63a,AITA for not saying thank you every time?,"My husband (39M) and I (38F) have had a long-standing morning routine where he makes coffee for himself and tea for me. He brings it to me at the kitchen table. This started during COVID and has been going on for about five years, every day. It’s one of those sweet, comforting routines in our marriage.

The other day, he brought me my tea as usual, and a few minutes later said, kindly but pointedly, “You didn’t say thank you for your tea.” I was surprised and a little upset. I didn’t think I needed to say thank you every single time - especially for something that’s become a part of our everyday rhythm. It’s not that I’m not grateful; I am. I’ve told him many times how much I appreciate the gesture and how much it means to me. I just didn’t think it had to be acknowledged every time.

This led to a broader debate between us: he feels that it’s important to show appreciation every time your partner does something kind, no matter how routine. I argued that while appreciation is important, expecting a daily thank you for something habitual starts to feel transactional.

We’re now at this sort of philosophical impasse: should you always say thank you for every repeated kindness in a relationship, or is it okay to let some things go unspoken once they’ve become part of the routine?

AITA for not saying thank you that one morning, and, more broadly, for thinking I shouldn’t have to say it every single time?

1k16xwl,AITA for making a joke about bread,"I (40F) made a loaf of white bread the other day. I’ve never been much of a cook, so I was pretty proud of myself. I FaceTimed my son (22M) to show him my success. 

For a little back story, my son’s wife makes bread as a hobby. Sourdough to be specific. I don’t like sourdough. The starter freaks me out and I think it looks nasty and sourdough is just too tough to enjoy. She posts it when she makes it, my son will post pictures of the loaves she makes when she draws a design on it and stuff. Since he seems so interested in the bread she makes, I figured he may wanna see the beauty I made. 

So as I’m FaceTiming him, I show him the bread. We talk for a moment. My son and I have always joked together, so I made a joke that my bread was probably better than his wife’s bread (because he knows that I prefer white bread to sourdough). He didn’t say anything about the joke, so I figured it just didn’t land. I talked to him a bit more, but he got busy doing other things so I said bye and hung up. 

Later, he texted me and said that he didn’t like my joke from earlier and he would prefer I didn’t try to “put down” others. I explained that I wasn’t putting anyone down, and that the joke was about how I don’t like sourdough. He said it was odd for me to specify his wife in the joke if I wasn’t joking about her, and I explained that it was because all she makes is sourdough. He kept going with it being a strange comment and told me to not specify his wife in jokes. At that point I got a weird feeling, so I asked if it was actually him messaging me, or if his wife has his phone. Then he blew up on me. He said I was acting like an asshole and that if I was going to keep acting that way, he didn’t want me to message him anymore. 

I still do think it was his wife messaging me, if I’m being completely honest. And if it wasn’t, I think he is totally over reacting. Now, he (or she) has his sisters in on it. My oldest daughter even said “it is weird that you wanna make bread all of a sudden when you barely cook.”

This person has also argued that I've made them feel isolated.

So l was hanging out with them, and three other people. I was having a conversation, yet this person was not engaging in the chat. I called on them a few times to join into our talk, but they kept minding to themself.
We were talking about games and memes, and this person suddenly changes the conversation to religion and how awful the world is.
I was being a clutz as I accidentally bumped, stepped on someone's shoe, and dropped something. This person said that I need to stop being clumsy, saying ""sorry"" and ""excuse me"" so much that they accused me of purposely annoying them.

After one of the friends leave, I try talking to them again and they responded with ""oh, you're interested in talking to me now that he's gone?"" 
I apologized, and they ranted at me that I steal all the attention from them, that I am douchebag and have made them feel miserable.

I've known this person since my freshman year of high school, I thought we were good until now with them saying that I'm a source to their problems in life. They even said that they despise me for ""easily getting dates with girls."" (I've dated 3 people in the past, currently with a new girlfriend almost a year into our relationship)

1k2u8y5,AITA for helping my friend win?,"So, I was in a game with my friend. Normal right? I he said he has never won EVER. I felt a bit bad and I helped him. Well the game has Factions and alligments. We were in the same faction but not alligment. I was in the end game, I couldn't win because I was weaker than everyone there, so I helped my friend win by voting the other person. They thought I was still in their alligment, so I said the faction I was in. They were still mad. I die shortly after and the others do to. They were mad but I saw that it wasn’t gamethrowing because I couldn't  win that, so I told them to suck it up and its just a game. Next game, im in the same lobby as some, most leaves and some stays. I tell them my friend is offline. They still Hunt me, and I end up dying. I cuss them out and then leaves when they die.
So, am I the asshole for helping my friend win? (By the way, gamethrowing only says outing your fellow faction members/ going against them, which i wasn't doing.

1k2s2u6,"AITA for forgetting to confirm grad pics and snapping after being called disrespectful, even though we already moved past the drama?","This involves my friend Anika, this girl Hannah, and me. I was mostly backing Anika but ended up getting dragged into the mess.

A few weeks ago, we had a late arrival day. Anika asked Hannah for a ride, but Hannah responded super late the night before, so Anika asked me instead. After that, Hannah went cold and never explained anything. I called the way she handled it immature.

Then, out of nowhere, Hannah and her sister Amber unfollowed us on everything and posted shady things that were clearly about us. We didn’t say anything publicly. I only vented to my friend Sam. we just told people Hannah had a family emergency to avoid drama.

Eventually, I messaged Hannah privately to clear the air:

	“I never wanted things to end over something small. The way it ended made me question if you ever wanted to be friends. I still appreciate the friendship we had. If you’re talking bad about me, that’s not okay—Anika and I haven’t. We’re graduating soon. I just want peace.”

She replied saying I disrespected her, backed Anika, and that she never talked about us. Then four days later, she called us and said she wanted to fix everything. We talked and moved on.

Then today, she texts:

	“When’s the date for the grad pics?”

I responded:

	“Sorry, I forgot to tell you. After everything happened, we had to confirm with my sister. When you left the group chats and unfollowed us, we thought you weren’t doing it anymore, so we asked Mary. I’m really sorry.”

She got upset, saying she already bought a dress and that I was being disrespectful by not telling her sooner. I said:

	“Wait I didn’t know you bought a dress. I’ve been on my period and feeling like crap. I forgot. You didn’t reach out either. Don’t come at me like this.”

She replied:

	“Don’t be disrespectful. I’m not stupid. If you weren’t stupid, you’d realize asking a question isn’t coming at you.”

Then her sister Amber DMs me:

	“Are you embarrassed yet? Hope you can get out of bed when your period’s controllable.”

I snapped and said:

	“Yeah I’m messy, but you and your sister keep dragging this. Leave me alone. I don’t even talk to you.”

Then blocked her.

But Hannah kept pushing, so I finally sent:

	“Are you fucking stupid? You left the group chats and unfollowed us why would we think you still wanted in?
I apologized, and I take it back. If it’s that deep, return the dress.
You didn’t even ask until the last minute. That’s on you.
You ghosted us and said you were ‘going through stuff’ so are we. The world doesn’t revolve around you.
If you didn’t want to be in pics, fine, but don’t come at me now.”

Then Amber messaged:

	“After seeing your prom pics, I’m restricting Hannah from doing anything with you. #nocharitywork. Also return the prom dress you need the money.”

So now I’m wondering AITA? I forgot to confirm the photo change and I owned that. But she escalated it, called me stupid and had her sister harass me I never wanted this to blow up again.

1k2lupx,AITAH for venting to my friend about how i felt about someone else and saying a kinda mean thing about them?,"Ok. Let me tell the whole story from the start. So lets call my friends: Emily, Anna, and Kate. So backstory, Anna is friends with Kate out of school. Me, Emily, and Anna go to the same school. Anna talks about Kate a lot. She also sometimes replaces things we were gonna do together by doing them with Kate instead. 

So one time i was texting Emily and venting about it. In one text all i said was “Kate probably sucks at volleyball” because she was replacing me for volleyball. I also said she would probably ditch Anna for the popular kids if she came to our school. (Anna really wants Kate to go to our school). So somehow Emily exposed my vent to Anna and she told Kate and Kate's friend, lets call Lily. So they all got mad at me and Kate even said she might tell the principal and the principal already thinks I’m a bully because of a previous incident that Anna and I did together, (we both were called “bullies” over something harmless)

 now Anna said to ""never do it again to Kate"" and dont get Emily involved cause it was “all me” (but Emily said she agreed with what i said about Kate when I vented) and also the things i said other than that Kate probably sucked at volleyball was that she was replacing me and that Kate and Anna have attachment issues because Anna wouldn’t even let Emily talk to Kate if they ever went on the bus together if Kate ever came to their school. So i vented about it and now everyone hates me and my life is over. 

They are ignoring how i felt about Kate always taking over and putting the blame on me. Btw, Emily and Anna are kinda the duo in my trio. They have known eachother their whole life while i have known them for 3 years. And if Anna tells the principal, i could expose her for something that happened a yesr ago where she bullied me, ditched me and backstabbed me so i dont think its a good idea for her to tell on me but idk if i should day that.

1k2hw4j,AITA for ruining by bestfriends birthday surprice cause i cant stand her bf?,"**A bit of backstory info**: My best friend has been with this guy for almost 2 years, and this guy has truly ruined . He constantly causes problems, gets jealous, causes her immense stress, and generally abuses her emotinally . I’ve told her countless times that she deserves better, but she doesn’t listen 

Anyway, it was her birthday, and with our friend group, we decided to throw her a surprise. Even though I wasn’t thrilled about it (full shade, btw), I thought we should include her boyfriend because I knew it would make her happy. So, *I* suggested  in the group chat we had with the rest of our friends about it , that he should be involved. Another friend of ours, who had a bad history with this guy’s best friend, asked if his best friend would be there too (because unfortunately, those two are like pot and kettle), and I told her obviously not, he has no business being there, and if he shows up, I’ll tell him to leave myself. Then another friend, half-seriously, half-jokingly, asked if it was really necessary for the boyfriend to come, and I, being honest, replied that it’s not my favorite thing, but for our friend, I can tolerate it. Anyway, we discussed a bit more in general, details about the surprise, and suddenly another girl from the group added my best friend’s boyfriend to the group chat. We told him what we had planned, he agreed, and the conversation ended there. I had completely forgotten about the existence of the earlier messages. 

Fast forward to the day of the surprise, and  we’re all waiting for my best friend’s boyfriend because he was supposed to bring the cake and the gift *that we all chipped in for* (*!!!!!!*). But he never shows up, and we’re blowing up his phone, and he doesn’t answer. We end up going to my best friend’s house alone to somehow explain what happened, but she doesn’t open the door even though we know she’s home. To cut a long story short, her brother eventually opens the door, and my best friend angrily tells us to leave. When I ask her what’s wrong, she says her boyfriend saw the messages where we were talking about him and got upset that we were badmouthing him. I admitted it was a mistake, but *he* was the one who didn’t show up and immaturely ruined the surprise. She then told us that he came at midnight with the cake and the gift (the ones *we* paid for, mind you) and gave her a perfectly fine surprise, unlike us, who didn’t bother to swallow our egos. And she especially blamed me, saying that as her best friend, I shouldn’t be talking about her boyfriend behind her back and that I’m to blame for everything. Okay, I get that I made a mistake, but I genuinely don’t think I was the jerk in this situation. Am I wrong? And if so, how can I fix my relationship with my best friend because she means a lot to me?",AmItheAsshole,Subject_Confection77,6,0.57,34,2025-04-18 22:48:46+00:00,Everyone Sucks,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k2hw4j/aita_for_ruining_by_bestfriends_birthday_surprice/,True,Everyone Sucks

1k2aiwu,"AITA: a trucker cussed me out for crossing the street when I wasn't supposed to, but he was speeding.","Context: I am a college student and I was walking back to my building. Just to set the scene, there is a cross walk that basically leads you straight to the entrance of the building. It's at an intersection with stop lights and pedestrian walking lights and stuff. 

Today, as I was walking, I noticed it had the ""dont walk"" signal for pedestrians. But when I looked around, there weren't any cars. All of a sudden this big truck (not really a semi truck, but kind of similar). Comes racing around the corner. The speed limit was 20mph in the street that I was walking across, which i didnt originally know, but i noticed he was going faster than usual. Normally, (since it's a campus) cars will just slow down a bit to give you time to pass, or they'll stop completely, if there's more than one person crossing (especially if there arent other cars behind it) Plus, the light was on yellow, I believe. I started walking across the street and he's going really fast. I kind of stopped for a moment in the middle of the road, then hesitantly moved forward bit by bit because I thought he was slowing down, which would've given me enough time to cross safely. But instead he keeps racing down the street and cussing me out. Mind you, he could've just slowed down to the speed limit and it would've been fine bc the lane he was driving in was at the halfway mark of the cross walk. I would've made it the rest of the way and he wouldn't have run me over. 

Idk, I know it's not that big of a deal, and maybe it was dumb for me to cross when the ""don't walk"" signal is on, but i also don't think it's justified to cuss ppl out.

1k1xibo,AITA because my Friend keeps asking me to travel with her but she keeps making excuses and its getting annoying,"I have a friend who keeps pestering me to go to Danang when I had already told her I’m not interested in going there.  

She said she just wants to travel so I suggested places like Osaka, Seoul, Jeju, Hong Kong etc. but she keeps saying “No I want to go to Danang and no one wants to go with me” I had already told her multiple times its not somewhere I’m interested in going. 

Then she suggested Seoul so I said okay cool. The. She goes “I want it to be a tour since I’m too lazy to fix my own visa and you have a multiple entry visa anyway” 

So I told her, I really don’t like going on tours and then she says “Its because if I’m not on a tour I barely leave the hotel” 

Then she suggested Japan today (everydat its a different place so its getting annoying), so I told her to fix her visa and then I suggested since its always a “visa” problem with her since she has mentioned she is too lazy to fix it for a DIY trip we just go to Singapore or if she wants Korea we can go to Jeju instead. 

She’s now saying Japan and she still wants it as a tour. I had suggested we go to Osaka since we have both been to Tokyo (separately) and she told me IN ALL CAPS that she doesnt want to go to Osaka and if we go it has to be on her terms as a tour since she doesn’t get up if its not a tour and ends up spending all day at the hotel. 

Also I pointed out to her that I went to Tokyo thrice last year so going again would be a waste of money and time on my end. 

Mind you I’m paying for myself so I feel like I have a say on it as well.

What can I do so she can stop pestering me, when I have clearly tried to set my boundaries 

And AITA for telling her that its getting annoying that she keeps asking me to travel when she won’t compromise 

Also I feel like I wont enjoy a trip with her and it would be like babysitting since even back home she is always late and all. She once had me wait 3 hours for her—her reason? She was too lazy to get out of bed. We planned lunch at 11 she arrived 3:30PM. 

Right now i feel like I shouldn’t even travel with her at all.

1k1soik,AITA Issues with participation,"Alright, AITA for telling a girl to play her instrument for an elective class she chose?

I'm in a band class which is an elective class containing between grades 9(freshmen)-12(seniors), in our band you are automatically part of the marching band AND the concert band on stages.

I've been sitting next to this girl who I'll call C. Well, C is a senior adult who I've been having issues with all year for her lack of participation in a class she chose. when we are suppose to be playing she will pick at her shoes with a pencil, play on her phone to text her boyfriend or her sister which sits a few seats away from her, she will also pick at her skin and basically do anything but playing. Am AITA for telling her to quit fucking around and play her instrument? We are not supposed to be on our phones during the class and shes remarked to me me to tell me to ""shut the fuck up"" It frustrates me how someone will participate in electives that are not required and then decide not to do what you are suppose to in the class.

AITA?


(UPDATE: about everyone saying it's April and they are seniors, in our school we just started our 4th marking period which is important for seniors and younger to graduate as it determines if you will continue on. If a senior failed a class in the fourth marking period, they would have to stay again the next year and be a ""Super Senior"" and the seniors don't technically get out of school until the end of May.

1k1ox6h,AITA for asking my friends to rewatch a tv episode?,"Hi! My friends and I have been watching TV shows together for a while. The group usually includes me, my cousin Ana, her boyfriend Francis, Ana's sister Clara, and sometimes my brother James (though he’s not involved in this situation). We take turns choosing what to watch, often picking shows someone’s already seen. Most recently, we watched *Attack on Titan* at Ana and Francis’ suggestion—even saw the finale in theaters.

It was my turn to pick, so I suggested *The Last of Us*, which I had already seen with my brother, but no one else in the group had finished. We'd tried watching it a year ago and made it through the first episode twice, but never followed through. Everyone agreed to try again, and we added Clara.

A few days later, I asked Ana if we could include our friend Marco, who’s been going through a rough time. We’ve been trying to cheer him up and include him in our plans. Ana said yes, so I invited Marco and he agreed.

Here’s where things got messy. I told Ana we should rewatch episode 1 together since Marco and Clara hadn’t seen it, and because it had been over a year. She refused, saying she’d already watched it multiple times and didn’t want to “waste time.” I reminded her I’d be rewatching the whole season and pointed out she just rewatched all of *AOT*. She argued the episode was too long. I said we should do it for Marco, and she finally agreed—but only if we watched it at double speed.

That same day, I asked the group if they wanted to start watching that night. Francis didn’t respond because he was gaming with two friends, Jhon and Jhosh. I joined them (even though I hate the mode they were playing) and asked again. Francis said yes, but Jhon and Jhosh, who had never watched shows with us before and had already seen *TLOU*, asked to join. I said sure.

Just before we started, Francis said we should skip episode 1 since he had already seen it. Jhon and Jhosh agreed and started prepping episode 2. I reminded them Marco and Clara hadn’t seen episode 1. They said it was too long and they'd rather move ahead. I said we always rewatch things and it’s about the shared experience, but they insisted Marco and Clara could just watch it on their own.

The conversation went on for 20 minutes. I finally said I thought it was selfish—by their logic, I could’ve told them to watch it on their own since I’d already seen it. That’s not the spirit of the group. I hung up, saw them keep gaming, and messaged Marco to apologize. He wasn’t too upset, but agreed it was weird—they could’ve just played the episode and chilled.

Now I’m not sure what’s going to happen. We’re supposed to watch the finale of another show tomorrow, but I’m waiting to see if anyone says something. If not, I’ll just watch it alone because I don’t want spoilers (which I usually get while waiting for everyone to agree on a time).

everyone laughed. i didn’t.



so i said, pretty calmly, “you know i actually took the IQ test last month and scored 134. that’s gifted range. so idk if that makes me fake smart but it's definitely smarter than average”



the room went quiet. one guy literally said “damn.” she turned bright red and said “well i could take that test and score higher” and i just said “then do it.”



next day she blocked me on everything and now two mutual friends said i embarrassed her and should’ve just let the comment go. but i didn’t even bring it up first. like i get that it sounded like a flex but why is it okay to call me dumb in front of people but not okay for me to respond with facts

1k0pxqf,AITA for not throwing away a piece of plastic,"let me explain, me and my bf are young we still live with our parents, because we both cannot to live by ourselves and i'm still going to school. this Sunday we were both hanging out and well one thing led to another and we had sex. we used a condom and after we even bought a take action emergency contraception to be extra safe. We were in the car when i. took the pill and he was telling me to throw it out the car window, something about me is i hate hate! littering it's a huge pet peeve of mine, so i waited until we got to a gas station and i threw out the box and well i thought everything else. the issue is i accidentally didn't take out all the pieces that i put in my purse, i left the small packaging the pill came in inside my purse. when i got home i emptied my purse and took everything out and i realized that this plastic was still there so i threw it away in a trash can i have in my room. also, just to add on i am on medication for other things so it just looked like something related to that and i didn't think much of it. a couple days after my mom confronted me when my dad was out the house, she cussed me out, called me a whore and 'easy'. she though it was BC but at that point i fessed up and told her the truth. both me and my boyfriend are adults and i feel like we should be able to have sex especially safe sex.

My mom on the other hand was calling me all of the names on the book. i understand her frustration because me and my boyfriend don't have a set future and anything can happen. my mom was telling me my boyfriend was going to leave me if i came out pregnant and that i was an idiot for allowing him to have me the was he did. so, am i the asshole?",AmItheAsshole,Pea-in-a-pod3794,0,0.4,8,2025-04-16 17:19:35+00:00,Everyone Sucks,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k0pxqf/aita_for_not_throwing_away_a_piece_of_plastic/,True,Everyone Sucks
1k0ngnx,AITA for refusing to like my friend’s post unless she like mine first?,"Alright, I need some input because I might be trippin’ here. I’ve been friends with this person for some time, but lately, I’ve been getting super annoyed with how she is acting on social media.

So I decided to hit her with the “I’m not liking your posts unless you like mine first” rule. Fair, right? But every time I don’t like her stuff, I get a message like, “Oh, you didn’t like my post? 😕” with that weird vibe. Like, really?

I tried explaining, like, “If you want me to engage, at least throw me a like too,” but she just don’t get it. Now things are mad awkward every time she post. I know I’m probably being a little petty, but honestly, this feels like the only way she'll get it.

1k0jyvw,AITAH for being jealous of my friend?,"The process of applying to scholarships has been very stressful. I’m a senior in high school and I’m not necessarily an “impressive” student, I have pretty good stats, but not anything amazing.

My friend, on the other hand, has been able to get multiple full ride scholarships and grants due to her financial status.

A couple weeks ago, I found out I won two scholarships that totaled out to be $3000. I was pretty excited about this, since I hadn’t heard back from any other scholarships that I had applied to previously, so I was getting pretty hopeless about being able to pay for college (my FAFSA SAI was a 13800 so im not receiving any financial aid from the government nor any college I got into, even though my parents can’t afford to help me pay for college). I told my friend about my scholarships, and she didn’t congratulate me once, the only thing she said was “That’s not bad. I’m lucky I don’t have to pay for college. In fact, I’m getting reimbursed for my tuition.”

I guess that comment threw me off guard a little? I’m obviously very happy that she doesn’t have to worry about the cost of college— and I have told her that many times in the past— but I just felt as if that wasn’t the best moment to bring it up. I know that just because I’m not getting full rides to college like she is doesn’t mean that she shouldn’t be able to celebrate her success but maybe it felt dismissive in that moment. I ended up just saying something like “Oh, nice” or “Good job!”

Yesterday, the results for a scholarship that many incoming freshmen get came out, and I knew that I probably wasn’t getting it, since the scholarship is heavily based off of financial need. My friend and I opened up our decisions together, and just as I expected, I didn’t get it. My friend, though, did. Right in that moment, I felt pretty disappointed that I didn’t get the scholarship, even though I saw it coming. I said “Congrats!! I’m jealous” because honestly, yes I’m pretty jealous of all the financial aid she’s receiving, but my tone + facial expressions definitely didn’t match the happiness I was trying to convey.

I guess she didn’t take this the way I intended, she was acting off and barely talked to. Later on, she told me that she didn’t think it was fair for me to be mad at her for being poor. This made me pretty angry since I was never mad at her for anything. Maybe I shouldn’t have said I was jealous of her, even though I meant it in the best way possible. I’m definitely not jealous of her financial situation, but I’m also very definitely jealous of the financial aid she’s receiving.

So again, the fact that she was accusing me of “being mad at her because she was poor” really did make me mad, since all the times she tells me about what scholarships she got, I always make sure to congratulate her, even when she’s dismissing my own accomplishments. I feel like it’s normal to be disappointed and jealous all at once.

1k0g79s,AITA for refusing to go under my father's care?,"[16m] I'm currently in high school and yeah i'll just make bullet points to make it more comprehensible.

1. I am a part of the school soccer team, and there's this one dude who was my friend in elementary school. I currently would consider him a friend asw but not really THAT close. Most of the other teammates have the same relationship w me.&#10;


2. My parents divorced when i was 10 due to excessive fighting and arguing and then my dad went no contact. My mom got rlly depressed and started drinking a lot. She also would skip work a lot. She also gets fits of rages which existed before divorce too where she can yell at anyone around her including me and thrash around. I would be stuck trying to make her sleep after drinking, doing chores, taking car eof the house and helping her w financial budgeting. She also currently has a boyfriend who she argues with a lot.&#10;


3. One day, my teammates (there were like 10) came over for pizza and vid games. I didn't know my mom would come home early from drinking and she was w her bf. She was pretty drunk so she was yelling at me in front of them so i tried taking her to another room and then she started throwing things around and obv that startled the teammates so i told the bf to handle it while i took them out for a pizza instead. &#10;


4. After a couple of days, my father shows up on our door. I got confused because why is he here and what does he want? Turned out that elementary school friend told his mom and he wanted her to call my dad about everything he knew. He also told my dad that i am supposedly ""depressed"", ""overworked"", ""angry"" because i was distant from other people, skipping school (can't i take a break?), talking back to teachers (only bec they were genuinely being illogical). Depressed? This is illogical because the only person that needs help is my mom. My dad then overstepped by telling me that i should be under his care now and he'd fight for it. Really? Its so stupid bec you have been no contact for years and now you decide to talk to me bec of a single call from someone i am not close to? I refused and told him he should instead pay for mom's therapy. I'll be fine bec i have a life and everything. My mom doesn't.&#10;


After that, i was just really angry at the friend for not talking to me beforehand and just throwing me into this unwanted situation. I decided to leave the soccer team too.

1k08ore,AITA for getting my friend kicked out of the Minecraft Movie,"AITA for getting my friend kicked out of the Minecraft

my friends and I went to watch the Minecraft movie recently. Unless u are living under a rock you probably know it’s become kind of a meme People are going full cosplay, screaming at scenes from the trailer, throwing popcorn it’s chaotic but in a kind of funny shared internet moment kind of way.

We were all down to be part of the fun but like within reason. Our group (11 of us) showed up, had our diamond swords and  light blue t shirts and dark blue joggers and we were all vibing. I was one of the people who set up this event i put in alot of effort making sure everyone could come and making the seating set up. One of our friends Jake me and him aren't very close but we are in the same friend group 

Before the trailers even ended, Jake was already throwing popcorn around he also started singing the creeper aw man song I told him to stop and he just brushed me off saying, “No one cares bro its just trailers ill stop when the movie starts.”

The moment that really pissed me off though was when, during the WATER BUCKET RELEASE scene, he stood up and threw his entire drink into the middle of our group.we were all soaked. I was sitting there with Sprite all over my new pants that I bought for the movie.

I was already mad and told him straight up that he needed to calm down or just leave. He laughed and told me to stop crashing out. Then came the infamous chicken jockey scene I was expecting a couple cheers I was planning on doing it too but Jake absolutely lost his mind. He screamed like a fricking banshee (can i swear on here idk?) He also jumped up on his seat and threw the rest of his popcorn bucket there wasnt much left. I saw the theater staff eyeing our row.

I told mu friend who I was sitting next to that I was getting some sweets but I actually went down to go talk to an employee I was worried they were gonna kick not only Jake out and the rest of us too I talked to the employee and told him jakes seat number and said he was acting out of control and I said sorry. They came over shortly after i came back from buying sweets and They kicked him out. The rest of us stayed and actually got to enjoy the rest of the movie (surprisingly decent, tbh).

Now Jake's furious saying I snitched and ruined the night (i have no idea how he found out it was me maybe i was to obvious). A couple of our friends are saying I was too harsh and that we all knew it was gonna be a wild experience anyway so I should’ve just let it go.

But man we were drenched, embarrassed, and not really having fun thanks to him.

1k077rb,"AITA for confronting my best friends wife, a week after their marriage?","\*\*\*-Please its a situation in an asian country i request all of western people to stay far from this post-\*\*\*  
My ex-bffs, Andy & Vas, just got married. I’d known them for 10 years since college. They were high school sweethearts who befriended me early on. I was dating a girl, Pra, until they introduced me to Dizzy. The 4 of us were a circle back then. One day, they asked what I thought of Dizzy-“just friends.” wo me, which changed everything

A fight broke out between Vas and Pra in the hostel. Andy, Vas,& Dizzy blamed Pra, and I, being the youngest and most naive, believed them. I cut Pra off, I (later found out Vas called her a psycho and that I would never love her in front of whole hostel) . After that, most girls in college avoided me. I spiraled into depression and poor health. I left the hostel and began seeing doctors weekly.

Only Dizzy spoke to me, and out of desperation ( been 5 months i talked to a girl properly), I asked her out. She rejected me, and soon both girls ghosted me. Dizzy started sleeping around with classmates, and people rub it in my face. I had three nervous breakdowns but kept it from my parents due to their heart conditions. I barely made the final year due to health issues.

Andy convinced me to join the gym, it made my health worse. I once fainted in front of Vas and she walked away. Andy later apologized for her.  
Me and andy applied for a job after college; Andy helped, but the girls still ignored me. In meantime Andy's sis  was getting married and he asks me to confront groom beforehand. We both go meet personally, I asks everything about him(bad habits and worse too). Good response and meantime we both now training for same company. Later, I met Vas after 3 years she barely acknowledged me. Andy kept asking for favors, but when it came to the final job exam, he helped everyone but me. I didn’t get the job, and he also didnt invite me for his sister's marriage but apologized about it later.

During COVID, I got better and got a job as Andy’s senior in the same company. He was jealous, you can see through it. He told me, Dizzy had moved in a serious relationship for last 3 years. I nearly broke down again but stayed composed. I asked him not to mention her again, he kept doing it anyway.

5 months ago, I moved abroad for master’s and recently saw their engagement post. Andy, texted daily, but hadn’t invited me . When I asked, gave excuses and told I’d be the best man at their wedding. I even prepared a gift of honey moon trip as sponsorship. They got married last week ,invited others, including Dizzy and a guy Andy hated. No one told me.

I even invited them all to my sister’s wedding. Some came. Still, none of them informed me about Andy’s.  
I feel like I lost 10 years to fake friends and emotional manipulation from all of them. I reached out Pra, she still replies to me in an instance but she's now in a good relationship.

1k02nl7,AITA- Told My Roommate I Don’t Want Random People in our Apartment,"I’ll start off by saying that I know that I’ve been in the wrong with this situation before. I am not an angel in this and if the comments agree that I’m an asshole, I can totally understand why. 

In our apartment, we don’t really get along which I don’t expect us all to be best friends. We’re three random people (24F, 29M and 27F) living together in an apartment, there is going to be some head butting. 

I’ve had my boyfriend over many times to stay overnight. I’m not saying that my roommate can’t have people over, it’s his house too. The only problem is that my roommate instead of asking for permission to have people over, he just kind of announces that some people will stay over. I would be fine with it if it was every once in a while.

Instead I would say that within the last two months he’s had like five/six friends stay over multiple days (once almost two weeks without asking) and just says they’re coming without asking what we think. Literally this: “My friend is coming over from Thursday to Friday”. We haven’t really discussed this situation, like having a sit down to make boundaries about the visitor situation. 

My roommate rightfully pointed out that I’ve had my boyfriend over many, many times. I know that we’ve probably bothered them too. My boyfriend also never stays over for more than a day or two. I also never have random friends sleep over at my house. 

My issue is that it’s several random people I don’t know staying in my house. I don’t know what their character is like or if they can be trusted having access to my room/bathroom when I’m not at home. My roommates know who my boyfriend is and generally keeps to himself and we don’t play music very loudly. This roommate’s friends play music loudly and talk extremely loudly too. 

I think this was a conversation that was bound to happen but after my roommate, once again, announced that a stranger was going to stay over three nights in a row, just invited his girlfriend over. I’m sick of having random people over without any say of how long they are allowed to stay. I know I’ve been inconsiderate myself and I said sorry for the situation, but I feel like because it’s my house too.

1jzvl94,AITA for telling my gfs mother she’s horrible.,"Okay so throwaway because my gf uses Reddit and I don’t need her to know I hate her mom yet. 

So I 19meters (lol) have a gf 19f. She’s the kindest sweetest person in the world, like genuinely. 

My problem is my gfs mother. She’s a horrible old lady and I hate her with every fibre of my being. She’s so mean to my gf no matter how much she does for her mom. Like yesterday my gf was sick and I went to go see her. She’s got her periods and the flu so like it’s a war zone. She’s throwing up, can barely walk and crying 24/7. I spend most of the day with her since I work night shift and she had sick leave.

And the whole reason she’s sick is because of her brothers. Her mom literally rubbed her brothers, made them soup and coddled them the whole time they were sick but she gave not one single fuck today. My gf was throwing up the whole day, not once did she ask if she was okay or if she needed anything. She acted like it was an inconvenience and my poor baby was crying. How can you treat your own daughter like this? 

Here’s where I may be the ah. As I was leaving, my gf was asleep in her room and her mom was downstairs coddling her little brother. I stopped and I asked her to just check on my gf through the night to make sure she’s okay and she gave me such a dirty look and like it genuinely pissed me off. I told her ‘she’s a horrible mother who for some reason hates the child who does the most for her and treats her lazy unhelpful sons like the sun shines out of their asses’ and then left. My gf hasn’t messaged me yet to berate me so maybe that’s good but am I the ahole?

ETA: she texted me back. She still likes me😩

Eta: hello everybody. Just to clarify a few things her brothers are 15 and 23. Her mother is not abusive, bitchy and kind of a c u next Tuesday? Yes. Also for those of you wondering if she's safe. Yes she is. She's staying at my house for the time being and were both supposed to be napping rn but I can't but she's snoring. We did find an apartment that's close to her school and quite safe. That's all I wanted because honestly I would hate to leave her alone at night by herself. We get to move in by the end of this month and were taking her cat. He's a nice grumpy old guy. Like he's 10 years old, I think that's old in cat years. Oh and to those of you trolls who were sooo pissed off that I actually like my gf, I hope you find someone to love you because bitter is not a good look. I have no idea how to update so Mb. I usually just scream into the void on my main. Bye love y'all😫

ETA: teeny tiny update but I’m happy to say that the monster in law is finally sick and now she’s suffering and my gf has been doing absolutely nothing to help her. Karma!

1jznt6u,AITA for making fun of a guy for not apologising?,"A friend (21M) said a slur, and another friend (25F) messaged him basically asking what that was about. 

He said he felt backed into a corner after having his world view questioned during the conversation he said it in and had wanted to go home for ages at that point, but that he apologised at the time and that it wouldn’t happen again. 25F pointed out that he didn’t actually apologise at the time and said that if hanging out with us made him ___phobic then maybe he should have just left. He said “idk what you want me to say”. She said maybe to take accountability and he didn’t reply. 

I asked him about that conversation next time I saw him and he snapped that he tried to explain but 25F immediately just started “yabbering on and hurling accusations at him”. We had an argument in person that we reached a tentative peace on. Later I messaged him saying that he had been really rude about 25F and he didn’t reply. 

I was potentially meant to be staying with 21M over the summer for an event. While we were texting the next day, I found a TikTok that said “apologise like a man in the comments” and the top comment was “idk what you want me to say”, word for word what he said to her about the slur. I sent it to him saying “you” and he said “if you still want to stay in my house I suggest not pissing me off at every opportunity”. 

I was pretty angry about that and the friendship dissolved. But I’m wondering was I the AH for bringing that up when I was meant to be staying in his house? In my head he had been really rude to 25F and not apologised for it so I saw it as fair game, but I’m wondering if I’m in the wrong for provoking him and being surprised when he said that about his house after.

1jzi7f0,AITA - for folding someone else laundry,"Hello, It's my first time in the subreddit but l'm actually curious since something just happened to me. 

Background information: I'm Italian currently living in South Korea, and for work I'm now travelling in the USA. 

In our hotel here in the States there is a room with two laundry and two dryer machines, me and my colleague went to do our laundry and up until that everything was fine, when we unloaded our clothes and needed the dryer we realised both were occupied but finished during our washing time (30 minutes) and then tried to wait 25 minutes to see if someone would come pick them up. 

After none showed we decided to open one to use it and fold their clothes and then went to the lobby waiting. In this time a lady came to speak to the receptionist and seemed mad but I was minding my business on the phone so I didn't pay attention to the conversation, I just noticed that she was mad when she said raising her voice ""I'll write a review to complain, you need to put a sign"" and then left. 

She came back again and asked us if we were the one who folded her laundry and I told her yes, and she start attacking me, saying that I shouldn't dare touch other people property, I tried to explain to her that we waited for someone to come but since none showed up we folded the clothes to use the machine and we're sorry if it bothered her in any way, but she kept going, also shouting at me insisting that I was there while she complained to the receptionist and pretended not to listen, when I tried to say that I was sorry again for the inconvenience she bursted saying I should just shut up and not touch people things. 

Here's the thing: automatic laundry places are not a thing where I grew up and where I'm living now (Seoul) it already happened to me multiple times for people to unload my clothes from the dryer, and I found it rude only when they didn't fold it, so in my mind if the person doesn't show up it's ""normal"" to solve it that way. Is there a laundry etiquette l'm not aware of?

1jz4mex,AITA For Telling A Ex-Friend That She's Not In A Fucking Wattpad Novel?,"

Ok so I'm 16F and my ex-friend,who I'll call Lila,is also 16F.
Me and Lila were in a friend group that formed in our homeroom with 2 other girls,Belle(16F) & Katie(16F). 

I became friends with Lila and introduced her to most of my friends and everything was fine for a while.
Then this annoying ass fucking girl started to constantly need to have all attention on her. Like bitch chill. Anyways she would cling to me at all times and at first I didn't say anything, despite me not liking physical touch unless I initiate it or they ask permission(which she never did),I didn't want to embarrass her or make her feel bad.

But it escalated,she proceeded to buy me small things then demand I pay her back for them, despite me telling her not to buy me things.
It pissed me off because this girl regularly gets an weekly allowance of at least $100 while I'm lucky enough to get $5 a week.

She had been going behind my back to MY friends and telling them how I was lucky to be her friend & that if it weren't for her I'd be all alone,like bitch the only reason she had friends was because I was her friend but whatever.

Anyways I dropped her as gently as I could telling her I needed space.
After I dropped her literally all her 'friends' stopped talking to her, everyone just ignores her now and I feel extremely bad about it,or I did until she decided that we were friends again and kept trying to cling to me.

It reached a point where I told her in our homeroom that we weren't in some fucking Wattpad fanfiction and that I wasn't going to magically get over everything she did. She started crying and looking around the room as if expecting fucking Harry Styles to walk in and propose or sum shit. When she realized that no one was going to defend her she started crying harder and said-( this is a direct quote btw)
 ""You are a friendless fucking savage, It's no wonder your dad fucking left you""

Btw I am mixed? I have multiple ethnicities but the culture that my mother raised me in was our Native American/Indigenous People culture,so the ""savage comment"" caught me off guard ngl.
Which ouch,ok,but wtv,only problem is that backfired on her,bc Katie & Belle started to yell at her.

She ran out crying.

I feel like TA for making her cry,I never wanted for her to lose her friends or be hurt I just wanted her to stop touching me.My mom says I should have just stayed her friend.
So AITA?

!Btw I js want to say that I DID start to enforce my boundaries. I would tell her I don't like to be touched and would push her off of me,this is usually when she would play the victim card and start crying,this is around the time I decided I needed to stop talking to her!",AmItheAsshole,igkms_0150,6,0.58,19,2025-04-14 17:28:46+00:00,Everyone Sucks,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1jz4mex/aita_for_telling_a_exfriend_that_shes_not_in_a/,True,Everyone Sucks
1k31xg1,AITA for continuing to spend money on in-game skins even though my girlfriend strongly disagrees with it and thinks I’m being financially irresponsible?,"I (24M) recently showed my girlfriend (22F) my bank account, and she saw that I had spent $20 on a skin in Marvel Rivals. She doesn’t like the game because she feels it contributes to the sexualization of women, and she told me that by buying skins like that, I’m supporting a harmful system. She sees me as part of the problem for continuing to spend money on these types of games.

We’ve had this argument before, especially about Fortnite, where I’ve spent quite a bit on skins over time. Her frustration is that these are free-to-play games, yet I keep spending money on them. When I try to explain that I just liked the skin, she cuts me off and says, “You’ve said that about so many others that just rot on your account and never get used again.” Then she asks me, “What do you even gain from spending money on something in a game that’s already free? Does it make you better player? Does it give you an ability? Will it help you win more games?”

I understand that it’s not just about the $20. It’s about the fact that we’ve argued about this before, and from her perspective, nothing has changed. I can see how it feels like I’m just brushing off her concerns by doing it again.

She also thinks I’m being financially irresponsible. And yeah, my income isn’t perfectly steady right now, but I still try to manage things. I make over $500 a week, and I put $300 into savings every paycheck. I use the remaining $200 or so for essentials and sometimes small things I want, like this skin. I know living paycheck to paycheck isn’t ideal, but I try not to overspend or put myself in a bad spot financially. Still, even if I have money left after saving and bills, she doesn’t think that justifies spending on something like this.

I get where she’s coming from, and I don’t want to dismiss her values or how she feels. I just also don’t think I’m doing something horribly wrong by using a bit of my own money on something I enjoy. I’m not sure how to explain that to her without sounding selfish.

AITA for continuing to buy skins even though it upsets her and my finances aren’t perfect?

⸻

TL;DR: I bought a $20 skin in a free game and my girlfriend got upset because she thinks it promotes harmful portrayals and that I’m being financially irresponsible. We’ve argued about this before, and she says I never change. I do save most of my paycheck and spend the rest carefully. When I explain that I just liked the skin, she says I’ve said that about a bunch of others I never use and asks what I even gain from it. AITA?

⸻

EDIT: I see i’ve been missing a few key information in here. We’ve been together for two years, long distance, I live in Texas while she lives in Sweden. I live with my grandparents and pay 5 bills in total adding close to $300+ but I manage to pay them off when due. I agree on her terms of the Rivals game sexualizing women but I do not play it for that reason. I spend money on games when a skin I like the look of comes out, but I also have the will to not buy it and just wait for a later day for when it comes back. She also has her own needs and buys clothes and here recently pokemon cards but she makes sure she has money for it just like how I do. If I’m missing anything, I may have already commented on it below, Thank you all for your input as well. It’s an eye opener for sure.",AmItheAsshole,NotGeekn,0,0.48,163,2025-04-19 17:45:19+00:00,No A-holes here,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k31xg1/aita_for_continuing_to_spend_money_on_ingame/,True,No A-holes here

She thinks she is entitled to control everyone around her whenever she needs help and I'm sick of it. She is leaving tomorrow for a 7days long trip, she booked the flight on a Saturday knowing that someone would take her to the airport, without asking first if someone could take her. Then yesterday she calls my husband 33M and asks him to take her inside the airport and show her where to go and drop her luggage because quote ""you travel so much and you know what to do"". Now the airport is not far from her home (like 30 min by car) but if we stay longer than 10 minutes in the parking lot we might take a ticket and I don't want to pay for the long stay. AITA? I Always feel like my husband and I are too kind and get stuck doing things BC otherwise we feel guilty or ungrateful. This is just the last example of her behaviour, she always invites us to her house and then suddenly there's something to do (like moving forniture or going to the dumpster) NOTE she has two sons,but she never asks my BIL 27M for help and HE STILL LIVES WITH HER! My husband and I live live like 1 hour from her and my husband works 12h a day while my BIL works from home but when she needs something she calls my husband because quote ""BIL is always so tired"". And this thing has been going on for years and still no one tells he anything they just go with it. And when someone tells her no she makes them feel guilty... I've had enough. So..AITA here?

UPDATE 


We all got together(me,husband, BIL, MIL and ex-husband) for lunch and to celebrate Easter.(This was set 2 weeks ago, I forgot to mention it in the original post) She didn't ask who was taking her and when it was time to leave  her ex-husband and my BIL took her. I don't know if they got inside with her, I'm just glad we didn't take her but this is a wake up call for both my husband and I, we need to set boundaries and not be afraid to stand up for ourselves like the grown adults we are. I showed him all the comments and he agreed to stand up to her more.

And because they didn’t have it she later told me she would try to find it in the Brazilian store she usually goes to and make it at home, but I told her not to bother and that I wasn't interested in trying it. 

She couldn’t understand why I wasn’t interested, so I told her that the whole idea of eating chicken hearts sounded a bit icky (that’s the word I remember saying, she later said I told her it was “disgusting”, so I can’t be sure, but the intention is the same anyway). And she got really upset and told me about how eating organs is not unusual in many cultures and that even if I didn’t want to try it, framing it as disgusting was disrespectful on my part. But I only said anything because she kept pushing for an explanation, so I don’t know what she expected me to do - to lie? ",AmItheAsshole,HilliamWurt,4570,0.87,1648,2025-04-19 02:21:10+00:00,No A-holes here,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k2lymy/aita_for_expressing_my_disgust_at_a_dish_from_my/,True,No A-holes here
1k2hg5p,WIBTA if I told my friend she might need to choose between her cat and moving in with us,"So for context, there’s me (19F), Friend A (19F), Friend B (18F), and Friend A’s boyfriend (BFA, 20M). Right now, Friend A and BFA already live together. Me and Friend B still live with our parents, but both of us are looking to move out due to personal and familial issues.

Because of the cost of living crisis, we’ve been talking about renting a 3-bedroom house together. It’d let us split costs, support each other, and live in a way that works long-term. We’ve all agreed this is something we want to do — and please know we’ve considered our options carefully, so we’re not looking for suggestions to “just stay with parents.” None of us are in a massive rush, but ideally, we want to have found and started applying for a place by the end of the year.

Friend A proposed this idea — she wants me and Friend B to live with her and BFA. Aside from financial reasons, Friend A has chronic health issues and doesn’t want to rely solely on BFA for support, since he works full time. Me and Friend B are happy to help. In return, Friend A is offering to cover 50% of both mine and Friend B’s portions of rent. This situation isn’t just about convenience — it’s a serious opportunity for independence and to get me and Friend B out of our current living situations.

Here’s where it gets complicated: Friend A has one dog (1yo German Shepherd) and three cats — the cats are bonded. Friend B also has two cats. One is extremely anxious, with severe social anxiety around people and animals, especially dogs, and doesn’t adjust well to change.

We’ve tried introducing Friend B’s anxious cat to Friend A’s cats, and it didn’t go well. It was tense, aggressive, and traumatic for the cat. And we haven’t even added the dog yet. Forcing all the animals to cohabitate would be cruel to them.

The issue is Friend B hasn’t acknowledged this might not be possible because of her cat. She’s holding out hope it can work. But she can’t leave her cat at her parents’ house (we’re moving within the same city, but that still isn’t an option for her), and obviously, we wouldn’t ask her to rehome her pet. It’s her baby.

At the same time, it wouldn’t be fair to ask Friend A to rehome her animals — they’re bonded, and it’s her home she’s opening up to me and Friend B. Asking her to compromise more than she already has doesn’t feel right.

Now, me and Friend A are stuck. We don’t want to be insensitive or damage our friendship with Friend B, but we also can’t keep stalling the moving process because of one cat. It feels like we’re in limbo because no one wants to say the hard thing — this might not be possible unless Friend B finds an alternative solution for her cat, and that might mean not moving in together.

1k2hdtd,AITA for TALKING to my BROTHER?,"I 19f am currently living with my parents during college break. I met my brother 23m at college and yes even though we have different parents he sees me as his little sister (one he lost after his mum had a premature baby) and I see him as almost a parental figure and the brother I never had. 

I live in college dorm and my brother lives at home because his home is nearby. While at dorm I talk to my brother regularly, basically everyday, telling him everything that happened that day. I tell all this to my mother too, and sometimes my father, as we're very close. No one at my college talks to their mum for an hour straight but I do.

Now that I'm home for the break, my parents object me talking to my brother. They say ""no siblings talk this much"" and ""you don't talk to us this much like you talk to him"" and stuff like that. They've set a limit to our call timings. Keep in mind my parents have very well met my brother on multiple occasions and he has been to my house twice too. 

I don't understand this behaviour shown by my parents. Are they jealous? Do they think we're ""pretending to be siblings"" or something disgusting like that? Is it wrong of me to consider someone else family and give him importance? I'm so lost here. I started not talking to my parents to maybe make them understand that I talk to them way too much but I don't think they see it. Now my mum is mad at me and saying ""you can't be in the wrong and angry at the same time"". 

They were my priority but they took it for granted (shutting me down on several occasions for ""talking too much"").

1k2b9on,WIBTAH if I told my BF to just go home after he spent the entire day of our weekend together sleeping?,"My (20f) bf (20m) came to visit me for the weekend. He isn't working and it's an extended weekend because of Easter.

We are partially long distance, since I study in the same city where he lives but go home for the weekends every week, and I live about 200km from the city where he lives. So we see each other monday-thursday and then I go home.

Today he arrived at about 2:15pm, talked to my parents and me for a bit and than at around 3:00pm he fell asleep. It's 8:00 pm rn and he is still asleep.

I've tried to wake him up but he just looked up at me and told me that he is getting up just to fall aleep right after. He does this ALL THE TIME when I am over at his house, but he's never done it to this extent when he was over at my place. For anyone wondering, he doesn't have any medical condition causing this. 

I literally haven't eaten all day because I feel embarrassed to tell my parents that I am eating alone because my boyfriend has been asleep since he fucking showed up. 

I am so angry at him. He always complains about us not spending enough time together and now when we can be together the entire weekend he does this? 

Don't get me wrong, if he was tired from the drive or whatever I wouldn't mind him taking a nap for an hour or two, but this is fucking ridiculous.

I have plans for the weekend and also a lot of work I need to finish and I've been seriously thinking about telling him to just go home, cause what's the point of him being here if he is just going to sleep the whole day? WIBTAH if I did that?

1k27178,AITA for not giving my housemate enough notice that I would be having someone over?,"I (21F) rent a 2 bdr apartment with my housemate (20F). We’ve lived together for 8 months. It’s been okay until recently.

The issue started when I made plans to meet my bf, who I’ve been dating for about 2 months. We’ve both been busy and finally had a chance to meet.

We first talked about meeting 5 days ago, but didn’t confirm it. When we finally decided to meet the next day, I messaged my housemate around 1 a.m. (I knew she’d be awake) and let her know I was having a friend over who’d be staying the night. I didn’t say it was my boyfriend. I also couldn’t give an exact arrival time.

She asked if it was “a girl or a boy,” and I said it was a boy.

She’s never met him, this would be his first time over.

She asked if I was serious, saying it was short notice. I said yes, and she replied “lol.”

Then she came to my room and asked why I told her so late. I said the plans were last minute.

She said since we live together, I can’t bring strangers over with such short notice. Please note: I’ve had guys over before, but this was the first time one would spend the night.

She brought up that when she had a friend over, she told me days in advance and made sure I was comfortable. She said my lack of communication upset her and that she wished I handled it better.

She also said she didn’t like how I gave short notice when others came over and mentioned she would go hang out with another friend every time, though I never asked her to leave.

I told her I understood I should’ve given her more notice, but he wouldn’t be interacting with her and would mostly stay in my room, only using the shared bathroom.

She said it’s not about who it is, it’s about how little she knows about the person, which makes her uncomfortable.

I told her I could cancel if she felt that uneasy, but she said she wasn’t asking me to do that,just to communicate sooner.

She added she’s not going to bend over backwards for my plans, but I hadn’t asked her to, since he wouldn’t be affecting her directly.

I started to think maybe I was being selfish and tried putting myself in her shoes—but realized I wouldn’t care if she brought someone over with short or no notice.

1k1xchn,AITA for cancelling plans on my boyfriend?,"I (21F) and my partner (27M) have been dating for around 3 months now. For context before we had even gotten into a relationship I had told my partner that these next few months / year I would be busy because I am a third year student about to do an internship this summer for my bachelor's program. He was aware that I would be busy and that school would be my priority, so if he was not okay with this he could opt out of not dating me.

So I recently got a paid internship out of the several unpaid options my class provides on a pre-approved list for my field work class. Since I'll be working as care giver I had to get a TB test, originally I was supposed to work tomorrow aka this Friday, but had to give away my shift so I could go back to the hospital to get my TB results read. My partner was originally supposed to hang out with friends this Friday, and had told me this last week that he was thinking of cancelling because he didn't want to drive to the city to hang out with his friends, before I had gotten the TB test scheduled / done I had proposed maybe I would switch my shift anyways so we could hang out. (Mind you I had never gotten a TB test before so I wasn't aware I had to go back in 72 hours to have the results read). Because I realized I not only had to go back to the hospital, but run to the store and get cat food, film a mock interview for my field work class, and prepare for a wedding that I'll be attending in a few weeks I told him that we shouldn't hang out and that maybe he shouldn't tag along to come get my results with me since my schedule is full. He said it was alright, however he was being very dry and giving one word responses which is very abnormal of him. I asked if he was mad at me, and he clarified he wasn't mad but was definitely annoyed. I reminded him that he had plans originally with friends this Friday, and cancelled them not because I asked him to hang out, but because he didn't feel like driving to the city. He keeps telling me it's alright and he isn't mad, but I can tell he is annoyed. I feel very guilty about it, I'm an ex people pleaser and I already hate asking people to cover my shifts / cancelling plans on people but I'm trying to be better at prioritizing myself and my needs. I'm also a little annoyed at him because even though he claims he wasn't ""throwing a fit"" he still was giving me one word responses and calling me even though he knew I was feeling sick and continuing to prod me about how I feel, especially because I had informed him I would be very busy prior to the relationship and that school is the priority, and even though he says he understands I can still tell he is disappointed whenever I have to cancel plans or tell him we can't hang out a certain day because I have school or class work or other responsibilities. 

edited to add: I am a very independent slightly more introverted person, I'm definitely the type of person that sees life as ""if you want things done the right way, do it yourself"" I don't need help kind of person. I don't really enjoy being babied or feeling like I have to baby other people, and I also thrive and enjoy being alone because I value having time to decompress. I would have invited him along if it was just small simple errands, but because I have to be at the hospital during a very certain time I can't afford to be late/ goof around. My boyfriend is an extroverted people person, and tends to get FOMO and makes himself sad when he cancels plans with friends or even me, even if it isn't anything exciting. He loves taking his time and going with the flow and isnt as time oriented as I am. He also is very much a hold the door open for my girlfriend, hold her bags, be very attentive boyfriend (which isn't bad but when im trying to actively do something important it can get in the way how attentive he is). He thrives on interactions with people, and doesn't like being left out, which I understand and I have dedicated a lot of time to him, but this is the reason why I left the decision to pursuing a relationship to him because I know my boundaries and what I'm like and try to make him a priority, but wouldn't want someone to feel neglected in a relationship with me. I also have had a conversation with him about how I'm not used to dedicating so much time to a person because all of my friends are introverted/ we hang out only on our breaks so every few months, and my last relationship was a LDR, so he was aware of what he was getting into before dating me, I was very transparent with the kind of person I am and what my schedule would look like.

1k1wvo8,WIBTA if I clipped a hangnail anywhere (indoors) that's not my house?,"I want to preface that I'm not trying to win an argument, I just want to know genuinely what people think. Not trying to be proven right or wrong. Rip into me, I want to know so I can change my behaviors if need be.

TLDR of the situation:  
Took the lady I work for to court for a hearing for a family member of hers. Could not bring in many things in my purse, did not know this because was not educated about government building regulations, items had to be returned to car including a nail clipper.

My (27f) bf (31nb) asked why I even carry nail clippers on me in the first place. I told him, to clip my hangnails of course! He said that it's *disgusting* that I would clip hangnails/dead skin in public buildings. They really emphasized that it's super gross to clip nails/skin anywhere but your own house. (Not that I clip my whole nail! That *would* be gross!)

I'm not exaggerating when I say I get hangnails every single day. I moisturize (Aveeno)! But my efforts are futile. I always carry a small nail clipper with me to clip them so I don't rip them off and cause my fingers to bleed. It's a self care thing. I used to pick and make my fingers bleed all the time. Carrying clippers helps to carefully remove peeling skin or jagged nail edges. (No, I don't bite my nails; never have. The sensation is AWFUL.)

Is it really bad that I will, in public indoor places, occasionally clip a tiny hangnail off? Is it honestly disgusting? I figure it's no worse than shedding a hair or two, or having tiny flakes of skin fall off of you at all times which is why there's dust everywhere. Dust is mostly human skin. So if I add a tiny piece of hangnail to somewhere, is it disgusting?

Also, I have mild Trichotillomania/Dermatillomania that gets worse with stress/boredom. Having a clipper on me literally, as mentioned before, prevents me from getting booboos.

One last thing, is that I'm a germophobe and have moderate contamination OCD. I don’t touch a lot of things, wash my hands constantly, always have hand sanitizer on me when I go out, use it a lot, and wash my hands at any given opportunity. (Part of why my hands are so dry is from constant hand washing.) I also wipe down things I touch a lot, like my phone, several times a week.

**WIBTA if I clipped my hangnails/dead skin at indoor public spaces (or someone else's house)?** (Again, this is for my own knowledge and benefit, I'm not trying to be proven right and shove it in my bf's face, quite the opposite. I want to know if he's right and I'm being gross.)

1k1wpqi,AITA for having different wants in a friendship?,"For some context, both me and someone who i will name ""A"" are recovering from a fallout in our friendship, we both suffer from severe BPD (borderline personality disorder) and we are eachothers FPS (favorite people/person), the fallout in question happened when A experienced an episode so bad that it resulted in everybody in their friend group leaving them, including me, I spent 2 hours trying to calm them down even though I wasn't in a good mental state myself, having been recovering from an extremely unhealthy breakup that was still very recent at the time, me and A spent around a week apart after this, and then I eventually went back to them after some convincing from a friend.

Me and A have been struggling alot ever since we got back, talking to eachother like we're afraid of saying the wrong thing, i didn't want to get too close to them again because I was afraid of developing feelings for them (which has happened before), meanwhile, they were afraid of telling me all of their true emotions because everytime they have spoken about their feelings, its ended in abandonment.

Yesterday, we had a conversation about how we both felt, and we found that we felt very similarly, but wanted different things— i wanted space, I wanted time for myself, to develop a schedule and a life outside of A because I've been falling apart due to not having anything else to do, meanwhile, they wanted to spend more time with me, because they become unstable whenever they're alone, they suffer from extreme loneliness and paranoia whenever I'm not around.

To describe our points of view better: im still recovering from a breakup that was extremely detrimental to my mental health, the turmoil of said breakup resulted in me finding difficulty telling the difference between platonic and romantic relationships, it caused me to develop an avoidant attachment style, caused me to become terrified of spending too much time with A in fear of developing feelings for them. (We used to spend the entire day together, now, we spend 10 hours together per their insistence, even though I want it to be less.)

A, on the other hand, is struggling with many things in their homelife, things that prevent them from developing a proper social life, that i will not disclose either, they suffer from impulsivity and many addictions, they're coping with the loss of their entire friend group (they lost said friend group due to the episode, I was the only one who came back) and im basically the only one they talk to on a daily basis.

My mental state is very fragile at this moment in time, and A is well aware of that, which is why they've been hiding their true feelings from me, telling me that they're fine when they really aren't— they've been helping me cope with my feelings, but I've been struggling to help them cope with theirs because of how fragile I am mentally (though I still try,) I just feel so frustrated, I feel so selfish for how I've been dealing with all of this, and I just want to know if I truely am being selfish.",AmItheAsshole,throwaway_287373,3,0.81,7,2025-04-18 04:45:31+00:00,No A-holes here,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k1wpqi/aita_for_having_different_wants_in_a_friendship/,True,No A-holes here
1k1v4gs,AITA for saying my wife’s feng shui nonsense is nonsense?,"My (29M) wife (27F) believes in feng shui. I've had to deal with some frankly annoying nonsense like no mirrors in the bedroom, plants in specific spots, etc. for years - I don't normally care too much but I don't believe in it. 

On Tuesday we wanted to change one of our ceiling lights. I took the old one down but we didn't like the new one. We returned it and got a different one, but we're going on vacation tomorrow and I was going to do it after we get back. 

The old light wasn't put back up, so the wires in the conduit are capped and spread apart. It's by our entryway and so there's essentially a hole in our ceiling. 

She claims this is bad feng shui and is the cause for all of her misfortune this week. For example:

1. She's had ""the worst yeast infection of [her] life"" (direct quote from her, and admittedly it seems really bad from what she's described)
2. There was a fraudulent charge on her Amex today
3. She has had some prospects at work ghost her this week
4. She was told by Amex her signup offer wasn't legit and she's SOL (CFPB complaint incoming)

Probably other things she's mentioned, but these are her main ones. 

My argument was that prior to taking off the light I had a legitimately shit day on Monday... I got amazing news this morning however that had to do with that shit day (can't get into it). 

So, AITA for saying her belief is nonsense and refusing to put up the old light before we go?

We can't put the new light up yet because the base is smaller than the old one and we have to paint that part of the ceiling first. 

Edit: I'm putting the old light back up tomorrow before we go, it'll make her happy and that's what matters.

1k16im7,AITA for not appreciating my sister for doing my laundry?,"I (26F) have shared a room with my sister (32F) since January (about 4 months). We live in a 2 bedroom apartment and have a roommate who lives in the second bedroom and plans to move in with her fiancé in 2 months, as the lease ends. 

For context, my sister and I split time between this apartment and our family home to spend time with our parents, which is about an hour away. She has lived in this apartment without me for about 3 years and I joined to help lower the cost of rent and provide company as her roommate makes plans to leave the space. They both work harder and longer hours than I do and as a result make more money and have less free time. My sister is also notably very selfless and overworked because of the nature of her job, and thus will get distracted by work calls or tasks that she needs to complete in the moment. 

Today, I left the apartment in the morning to go to work as usual and left my pajamas on my bed to return to that night (I usually come to the apartment on Monday night and stay until Thursday night and use the same pajamas for the week). My sister worked from home and decided to do her own laundry. She decided to grab my pajamas from my bed and throw them in with her laundry before I got home. She then left the apartment to go to dinner and hang out at her boyfriend’s apartment. I was at a baseball game and then came home around 11PM. 

By the time I got home I began to wash up and try to go to bed. That’s when I realized that my pajamas were missing and thought maybe she had thrown them into the washer. I checked and learned that she had put them into the washer but had not finished the job by drying the clothes. Normally I would have other pajama shorts to wear to bed but this week I forgot to bring more and am relying on this one pair for the 3 nights here. 

I am now waiting for 2 hours for the dryer to finish (it’s not the strongest or best dryer in the world) and am feeling quite frustrated about the half job that she’s done. I know I should be appreciative that she cares to take care of me and my “dirty” laundry, but I feel frustrated that she did this without me asking and didn’t care enough to finish the job, ultimately inconveniencing me to the point of having to wait for the laundry to be done before I can go to bed.

1k13095,AITA for being a liar as a child?,"I (16F) have got 3 friends (all 16F) who have been with me since grade 1. They're my closest friends, the ones I trust the most, share everything with, (I wish I could say 'and vice versa' here) they're my best friends basically. 

We're all into different colleges, chasing different goals but still we are in contact. We talk and hang out sometimes. One day, we were bored and had decided to meet at one of our friends house, play UNO, have some ramen, and chill yk. So we did and when we were having a convo, one of em randomly asked if we have ever lied to each other. All three of them said maybe once or twice but not more than that. I honestly told them that when we were younger, I loved making up stories and telling em. Mostly it'd be 'paranormal experiences' and stuff. I did it to look cool man, I admitted that I was a liar as a child. They said that they believed everything I said, and that my stories were really believable. 

Then suddenly their tone changed and they asked ""do you still lie though?"" I said ""nope, Ofcourse no one would believe my weird stories now."" To which one of them said ""sometimes you still do tell us weird stories, how do we know they're real and you're not lying?"" I replied ""Well, then you gotta trust me, I'm telling you the truth, I don't lie anymore"". I added ""tbh, sometimes when I'm feeling lazy to do something, I do lie about having some work or not feeling well, being busy just so that I won't have to go out"" 

Two of my friends thought that's alright, but one of them, let's call her Emily, who is the closest to me, kind of started to be a little distant from me. She doesn't talk to me the way she did before and when asked, why? She said ""I don't think I can trust you anymore, All this time I trusted you, but you're such a liar."" I was like whaaaaaaat? First thought she's kidding but when realised she's not, I asked her why she thinks that. Emily said ""I hate liars, didn't expect you to be one. You've been lying about alot of things all your life, and we innocent people believed you"" I. Was so confused. I'm 99.9% sure that all I've ever lied was when I was a child, and the stories I made up back then, and probably faking about having work and being sick to avoid going out cuz I'm a LAZY BUM! She disagreed and said ""there have been many instances where you have lied, and it's very recent."" This confused me so much, I don't think I've lied. But she wouldn't tell me what it was and told me not to bother her. This really shattered me from inside, I feel there's some misunderstanding. I dont want our friendship to end because of it but she won't communicate!

1k124n4,AITA if I don't want my sister's partner at my birthday celebration?,"My (26F) sister (24) has been with her partner (34M) for around 5 years, and they have a soon-to-be 4yo together.

 I invited my sister to celebrate my birthday, and she asked if he could also come. I only feel like TA because my boyfriend was welcome to celebrate her birthday with us (even though he didn't come.)

The problem is, dude drives me up the wall. He's very immature for his age, like he got stuck at 16. He isn't the brightest, and likes to try to butt into conversations and talk like he understands the subject when he obviously has no clue. He's a ""sovereign citizen,"" really into conspiracy theories, and likes to wear a belt with a hunting knife on it everywhere he goes. He isn't rude, per se, he just doesn't know how to socialize appropriately for his age, and sometimes it feels like my sister is babysitting him. She literally has to tell him what to do or not to do half the time.

I didn't want to invite him when I hosted Christmas this last year, but felt like I had to because it wouldn't be fair to my niece to not have both of her parents around. 

So, AITA??

1k0mezv,WIBTA if I told my dad to break up with his gf because she is bullying him?,"
My step mom has been in my life for over 10 years (im 19). She at one point lived in the house me and my dad used to live in (we moved so I don't see her much anymore) and while living together she took the strict rules from her household to ours, making me change my habits completely.  
Part of this I was fine with, and I respect her for now, she really helped getting us to behave better but at certain points it seemed too much.  
For example if I didn't clean up she would put everything I had on the floor into the trash, even if it had just fallen down, not caring what the items meant to me. 
Not only did she yell at me but also at my dad for not ""teaching me correctly"" even if it came to things such as me forgetting to say ""thank you"" after eating or moving my chair in after standing up. she's also reminds me off these things as well as small mistakes I made that she had to tell others about making me embarrassed and even more socially anxious than I already am.
this is how she treated HER kids, but her kids also grew up with it and don't have adhd and asd growing up, so I'd imagine it'd be easier for them. Anyways


So a couple of weeks ago me and my dad decided we were gonna see my siblings kid on her ""gymnastics-dance"" competition. Right of the bat when I found out my step mom is coming with I got really anxious but brushed it off as it's only for a day and I hadn't seen her in ages.
I decided I might as well be nice and greet her, there's no reason for me to act rude because she hadn't exactly been bothering me much since me and my dad moved.
 we didn't have a great start. I was ready the desired time but my dad didn't seem in a rush so I grabbed some extra stuff like earrings and stuff to make sure I had everything. We left at like 10 minutes later and went to pick my step mom up, when we arrived at her place she made a snarky comment about, she said, and i quote: ""i didn't expect y'all to leave on time anyways so I didn't bother waiting in the same spot"". my dad responded that it was his fault we went off late bc it seemed a little early to leave, she didn't respond.
During the whole trip she barely talked to me but made many snarky comments to both me and my dad.  she asked why he hadn't fixed the car window yet and he responded that he hasn't found the time, she said: ""just like everything else you 'don't have time with' bc you're infront of your tv whenever you don't have work"" and after lunch when we were standing up she said ""come on push in your chair, you're not at home anymore"" (mind you my dad was on his way to push in the chair),she was practically mocking him for HIS lifestyle and the only time she seemed happy about was seeing my sister. 
Otherwise all she did was compare my sisters child to me and talk about how bad of a parent my dad was when I was younger.


Lemme know if there's anymore details yall need to know.

1k08e08,AITA for possibly opening my father upto criminal liability for tax fraud?,"# I have some suspicious stuff in my tax history from when I was a teenager, and I think my father used my identity to reduce his tax burden or something. When I check my CRA (Canada's IRS) account, i see ""Capital Gains Deduction"" dating back several decades, to when I was just an early teenager. Apparantly tax returns were done back during those years. My dad owned a business back then but when I ask him about whether he used my name for anything he says ""i don’t remember"".

1jzwqeh,AITA for not being totally honest to my friends in regards to my university course?,"
I made a few close friends within this course. They were very different type of people in comparison to myself in terms of personality. They were outgoing, extroverted and could say their mind whereas I was always pretty introverted and more quiet. We always got on pretty well. They would often talk constantly about going on dates/hooking up with diff people every week and would discuss and joke about a lot of se*ual stuff just in general. I was never really the type of person to be interested in going on dates with diff people and just all that in general. I should have probably communicated this better but anyways.

We went on a friends holiday back in August 2024, during our annual leave from university. Fast forward this holiday happens and I’m not going to go into too much detail about it, let’s just say I was made to feel very uncomfortable when we would go out at night and they would leave me in the club by myself whilst they all went and sat outside. This made me feel very uncomfortable 

Anyways ever since then I saw a different side to them, and the way this worked, we went on this 2 week holiday and then straight back to university so I personally felt as though I hadn’t really had any time to myself to think things through properly and self reflect on just everything going on including my stress with the uni course. The term passes by (5/6 weeks of theory) and I am spending time with these people a good few times a week. There were occasional times where I felt mildly uncomfortable by a remark that one of them would say to me (this happened on the trip as well) and through time it’s almost as if I felt nervous to be around them. As though I couldn’t be my true self.

So anyways few weeks pass by and I go into a depressive state, again, to cut a long story short, I make the decision to go ahead and leave the course without telling any of them. I leave the groupchat which prompts them to ask me why. A couple of months pass by since talking to them and I feel much more at peace. However they invite me out for a birthday night out (my birthday). Why I said yes I don’t know, but anyways I was looking forward to it not realising how it was gonna go.

Basically for the couple of hours we were out for the main topic of the conversation was why I left university (despite me having told them in our personal group chat beforehand), they couldn’t understand why I had done it, why I hadn’t told them, admitted it was a “kick in the teeth” for them to have found out “through others”. I felt bad then at the time but now I’m just generally curious to know. I will admit I should have been more upfront about everything at the time and used my voice more but I personally didn’t feel like I could, and that they would’ve disregarded it anyways.

1jzr9so,AITA - Bachelorette Party Planning Edition,"EDIT: Appreciate all of the opinions, just want to clarify something. She never said before booking she was uncomfortable, only after. Sure, maybe I should’ve shown everyone the plan before hand and that’s where I messed up and I’ll own that. However, nobody asked me to help plan, nobody volunteered extra ideas when asked so I went off the surveys and feedback I did have. Also, it’s a super popular show and not a strip club lol audience participation is 100% optional and we’re not hitting the ATM for singles and paying for private dances in the back?

—

I am the Maid of Honor in my best friend's wedding that's happening this July, and she has tasked be with planning out a long weekend in Vegas for her bachelorette trip (Friday night to Monday morning). In planning, we (the bride and I) sent out a survey this last December for all of the other bridesmaids to fill out (5 others). In this survey we asked for budget on lodging, budget on activities, activities they would recommend us doing, and activities they either didn't want to do/didn't feel comfortable doing. In getting these surveys back, most of the girls in their reply said it would be so fun to go to a male revue show, except for one girl. This one girl, we can call her Ana, left both of the activity categories blank but filled out every other question about budget so we know she 1) read it and 2) actually put some thought into her answers.

As I am booking, I'm trying to keep most things a surprise for the bride (per her request) and am planning away. I'm really taking the answers in the survey and budgets to heart as I'm trying to piece together this trip for 7 girls located across the US. I booked a table share  one night, a nice dinner another, and a few other more affordable brunch/dinner things as well as am working with promoters to get us into other clubs for free to help make it as affordable as possible but while still checking all of the boxes of a Vegas bachelorette. I, of course, booked a male revue show (Thunder Down Under) because the bride loves Australia, she's been and wants to go back and a revue show would be so fun and she is so so down, as is just about everyone else. I book it, sent the other girls their share of tickets, and Ana reaches out to the bride and 1) spoils the surprise, but 2) says she's really not comfortable going.

I already bought the tickets and am pretty sure they're nonrefundable, but that's whatever I'll probably just eat the cost of it. But what really makes me wonder if ITA, is that she is now going to be by herself after dinner if we don't change the plans. Should I have asked the group specially about attending a show like this before booking? My assumption was that if they were really not wanting to go/uncomfortable they would've voiced that in the survey. But I know what they say about assuming.....but bffr it's a Vegas bachelorette!!

But what really gets me is that Ana dumped this whole sappy story on the bride and then I had to reach out to Ana and say it's fine, yada yada, we'll miss you, let me know if you change your mind sort of thing. But like.........the surprise is ruined and the bride feels bad someone is going to be alone and this all IMO could've been avoided if she had just said something. I should also reiterate that the bride chose to do Vegas for her bachelorette because she wanted to do the stereotypical things- she wanted to party she wanted to go to shows and she wanted to have a fun, 20-something, Vegas bachelorette party.

1jz9z3p,AITA for dying my hair?,"I (14F) have been wanting to dye my hair, my parents don't approve of this, because they say: ""Why do you need to dye it?"" or ""Your blonde hair is fine rn!"" Yeah I mean I get that, but I'm a teen now. My bestie let's call her Rune, she also dyed her hair, but no I'm not saying: ""My bestie did it first so I wanna do it too!"" I just want to dye the bottom light blue, like an obmre! So when I stayed over at my aunt's I vented to her abt what happened, and she said: ""Yk what, I'll let you!"" So ik im going against my parents' approval, but when I called them I said: ""Hey I'm going to the salon to-"" but they cut me off right there. Apparently they were praising my sister, oh ya forgot to say, I have a younger sister, 11F. So I dyed my hair. When I came home, my family didnt even look at me, all they said was, ""Welcome back,"" While brushing my sister's hair. ""Have fun at boring auntie's house?"" my sister asked, eating icecream. But my parents turned around once my sister gasped at my hair. ""WHY WOULD YOU DYE YOUR HAIR?!?!"" they yelled. ""YOU DIDN'T EVEN TELL US?"" But I did, they just decided to cut me off. My sister screamed that I didn't have any right to go beyond my parents choices for doing something with my hair? But she still goes beyond their choices for going off with friends when she's supposed do piano lessons. My sister said she wanted to dye her hair too, and started yelling and crashing out. My parents grounded me, and now I feel terrible about dying my hair, I shouldn't have went behind their backs about it, so now I'm going to the salon to get the dye out.

1jz422w,AITA for not giving my cousin the chance to apologize for something she said about me behind my back?,"I (25F) took some time off work to help a family member with medical issues, and after that, I had a really hard time finding steady work. For months, I did odd jobs, but nothing in my field was working out.

One day, I went to hang out with my friend (25F), we'll call her Kate, to catch up. Kate and I were just sitting around talking since I didn’t have the money to do anything else. During the hangout, my cousin (also 25F) called Kate and she answered the phone on speaker without telling my cousin I was in the room. The second my name came up in the conversation, my cousin started going off about how I should just ""get a fast food job"" or something to make money and stop complaining about not being able to do anything. She continued with, ""It's not fair to the rest of us that we can't have fun because OP chooses to be broke.""

I was totally shocked. My cousin and I have always been close—like best friends. We grew up together, went to college in the same city, and have always supported each other. So hearing her say that was incredibly hurtful, especially considering she’s always been empathetic. She had also recently found a job in her high-demand field very quickly, which made her comment feel even more dismissive, given that my career path is harder to break into.

Kate quickly ended the call and apologized, but I was devastated. I didn’t want my cousin to know that I overheard, so I asked Kate not to tell her. Since then, I’ve been distant from my cousin. I’ve told my immediate family about what happened, but they think I’m being dramatic and that I should tell her what happened and let her apologize. The thing is, I don’t know if I could trust an apology after hearing that.

1jz3s9f,AITA for Wanting a Partial Refund on Shoes I Bought on Vinted Bc They Had Chewed Gum on the Bottom?,"I (40/F) have purchased some shoes for my daughter (1/F) on Vinted, which if you’re not in the UK is like Poshmark. I’ve had pretty good luck with infant and toddler clothes because kids often wear things 1-2 times before they outgrow them. 

Anyway, she’s starting to walk, so she now needs shoes with actual soles. I bought her a pair of converse online that were half the price of new ones. They didn’t look like they had been worn more than 1-2 times and were listed in very good condition, no photo of the soles and no mention of the gum (just adding that on sites like this, listing imperfections is expected so you can make an informed decision).

When I got the shoes, there was a big chunk of dried, chewed gum on the bottom as though the previous child had stepped in it, but everything else was fine. I started to try to remove it and got some off, then remembered to snap a photo. I looked at the listing again, and there was no mention of it and no photo of the soles.  

I requested a full refund by accident and the seller then responded saying she wanted the shoes back. I told her I was sorry and that I wanted to keep them and don’t think a full refund is warranted, but £5 or so would do as I paid £20 shipped. 

She responded telling me she was shocked I would ask for any money off and if I want to keep them, it can’t be that bad. She said it was “a little something sticky” and that if I don’t like it, I can send them back to her and she’ll find someone who will appreciate them. 

I’ve gotten quite frustrated because Vinted keeps telling me to click a button I literally cannot find in order to report that we can’t agree. 

My husband (35/m) told me that it was just gum on a shoe and not to get so worked up. Like, I know people are dying, etc., but AITA? Should this be expected? I’ve had a lot of luck here first year with stuff on there and never had something like this happen.
