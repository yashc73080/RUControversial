1k6igkk,AITA for freaking out when my mom has to watch me and my brother alone?,"I am 14F with a 13M brother with OCD. My mom has a habit of setting off my brother's OCD and on occasion yelling at him or ""grounding him"" to our room when he gets upset at this. This isn't usually a problem with my dad around and is the basis of this post.

Next week my dad is driving my half-brother back from college and my mom has to watch me and my brother and I freaked out a bit and my mom thinks I'm being an asshole and over reacting. I love my mom, but when ever she watches me and my brother without my dad to mediate, things go to shit really quickly. 

One of the recent times she has watched us, she was yelling at my brother and going to far. She was standing in the door way of our room so I grabbed her arm and tried to pull her away. We got in an argument that lead to me having a breakdown. (I won't go into too much detail because this isn't the main focus)

Anyways, my brother's OCD has been worse lately, so I'm really worried about this upcoming week and what could happen. I know from my mom's POV, seeing me anxious and dreading the week she gets to watch me and my brother could feel heart breaking, but I can't see a way for me to just drop everything that has happened in the past. I feel awful about it but I know what these times can do to me and my brother, so AITA?",AmItheAsshole,Just_A_RandomMate,5,0.78,12,2025-04-24 03:25:04+00:00,Not the A-hole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k6igkk/aita_for_freaking_out_when_my_mom_has_to_watch_me/,True,Not the A-hole

1k6gmp6,AITA for not letting my bf use my desk chair?,"I (34NB) and my bf(35M) have been living together for 9 months now, and just had and uncomfortable convo today about me not letting him use my desk chair.
Some info is:
- we have individual desks and individual desk chairs. 
- he bought his chair in the last months and before that he borrowed mine from time to time.
- I come from a better off family, but I we are both professionals (studied at uni) and we both earn almost exactly the same monthly.
- his chair is way cheaper that mine (like mine is maybe 3x) and he bought the very cheapest that he could found.
- his chair is really uncomfortable and uses mine when I'm not home.
- I came into the relationship with more material stuff and several of the furniture and appliances are originally mine but we both use them. Now when we buy things for the home we both pay 50/50 for it and also we share 50/50 on rent, bills and groceries.

Today I came home and asked him why he was using my chair (and desk) I told him he could use it if he promised to buy a new chair in a few months when he receives a bonus from a new project. Maybe I didn't use the best tone tho, but I tried to be civil.

He said he won't use my chair anymore but got really sad and later called me egoist and materialistic.
Im hurt and think he's being kinda freeloader.

He has borrowed some things a few times before and I ended up give them up to him because he worn them out.

I'm and being egoist? I'm afraid this will continue to happen because he tends to buy cheap and I tend to buy things to last.

1k6flrt,AITA for not sharing my switch,"So me 14f and my younger sister 12f have our own switches. I have the original switch and she has the switch lite.(she asked for it) My sister has asked me multiple times to borrow my switch to play games that she can’t play on the lite. I said no cause i using it at the time and she left. After that, she would nonstop bother me about using my switch for games after I continuously said no. Then my parents got involved and they decided to just buy her own switch instead as an early Christmas gift. They still bother me to this day about how selfish i was for not sharing. Mind you I am autistic i never really feel comfortable with other people using my things.

1k6f7ew,AITA for trying to set a boundary with my mom?,"I (23M) had to move back in with my mom (56F) about 3 months ago after my apartment complex was shut down due to black mold. I originally planned to move into another place with my roommate and his girlfriend, but my mom convinced me it’d be smarter to live at home for a year, save money, buy a car, and finish school. Financially, it made sense, so I agreed, reluctantly. We’ve always clashed and don’t see eye to eye on much.

The main issue is her passive-aggressive behavior and setting unspoken expectations. She’ll get upset when things don’t go as she imagined, even if nothing was agreed on.

For example, I’ve been trying to cut sugar and started buying drinks like sugar-free soda to test out. I picked up a $3 bottle of sugar-free Mountain Dew to try before committing to a 12-pack. She was with me and agreed it was a smart idea.

Later that week, I come home from the gym and she casually mentions how good the drink was. I go to get some and it’s gone. My dad laughs and says, “It’s already gone.” I got annoyed and said it would’ve been nice if someone had asked. She immediately got defensive and said, “Well how do you think I feel?” as if she was the one wronged. We argued, I left to cool off.

I vented to my girlfriend, who showed up later with a 12-pack (super sweet and unprompted). When my mom saw it, she said, “Really? You made her go get you more?” I explained what happened and she laughed, told me to “man up” and stop “bitching” that I could’ve just bought another bottle. I said that was unkind, especially when I was clear about wanting to try it first.

Then today: I bought chicken with my sister and put it in the basement fridge (the one my mom rarely checks). I went to grab it later, and my mom followed me into my room and said, “You little brat, you’re not going to share that?” I told her I bought it. She brought up how much food I’ve eaten in the house. I reminded her I mostly eat only when she invites me to dinner and buy my own snacks/drinks.

She gave me this smug smile and said, “Okay, I’ll remember that.” I told her I don’t mind sharing I’d just like to be asked. She snapped, “I don’t need to ask.” I offered her some anyway and she responded with, “No thank you, I don’t want it anymore,” in this weirdly smug tone and walked away.

I was left just sitting there, stunned. I don’t feel like I’m doing anything wrong, but when I set basic boundaries, she acts like I’ve insulted her. She constantly brings up how much I ate as a teen, even though I’ve been trying to be respectful and self-sufficient. These are just a couple recent examples, but it’s been like this since I moved back.

So, AITA? I feel like I’m going crazy trying to navigate this dynamic. I try to act like an adult, but it feels like I’m walking on eggshells",AmItheAsshole,frick_fracc_,48,0.93,44,2025-04-24 00:42:42+00:00,Not the A-hole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k6f7ew/aita_for_trying_to_set_a_boundary_with_my_mom/,True,Not the A-hole
1k6f09d,AITA for publicly shaming two elderly neighbors and filing a lawsuit against them?,"So, I (M, 30s) live in a mid-sized apartment building with a pretty standard setup: there’s a building council that oversees maintenance, budget, admin stuff, etc. Everything went relatively smooth until two elderly neighbors — let’s call them Mike and Mod (both in their 60s-70s) — decided to make the building their personal chessboard.

Mike and Mod got themselves voted onto the council this year, but not exactly by the book. They took over the annual assembly as “president” and “secretary” of the session (despite not being neutral parties), changed the voting rules mid-meeting, and ignored every objection that didn’t suit them. The official minutes that came out later? Full of omissions and lies — including a claim that the vote for the council (which they now sat on) was *unanimous*. Spoiler: it wasn’t. I was the only one actually voted in through real consensus.

Since then, they’ve overstepped their role over and over — publishing official documents before they were even registered with local authorities, acting on behalf of the building without authorization, and most recently trying to get me to sign off on a contract ""*as a council""* without even involving the building’s administrator. That’s illegal where we live.

Earlier this year, Mike  made a completely false claim that the community could be subject to asset seizures due to a pending labor lawsuit — again, not how the law works. I’m fairly certain that was meant to scare everyone into letting them settle things without review or transparency.

I tried to handle things quietly. I’ve been patient. I’ve offered peaceful ways out. But now? I’ve filed a lawsuit to challenge the legitimacy of the assembly minutes and their actions. I’m also preparing a full public report to the community, detailing everything — and yeah, it names names.

I’ve been told I’m being petty, or cruel — that they’re elderly and maybe they didn’t mean harm. But at some point, “not meaning harm” still leads to serious consequences. They’ve lied, manipulated, and acted like they were above oversight. The community deserves the full truth.

**AITA for going full transparency mode and dragging them publicly (and legally) after trying to keep things civil for months?**

**TL;DR**: Two elderly neighbors hijacked the building council through sketchy means, lied in the official records, overstepped their legal authority multiple times, and spread misinformation. After months of trying to handle it quietly, I filed a lawsuit and went public with the receipts. Now some say I’m being mean to old folks.

1k6cvh7,AITA for leaving to have my break in another room when someone else walked into the one I was already in?,"Apologies for any grammer mistakes, writing this in a waiting room and I think im being called up next so im not really spell checking anything. 

Okay so for some context my workplace has 4 small break rooms. We're allowed to take our breaks whenever we want and because we dont have alot of employees at the moment most of the time when I take my break no one else is present in any of the rooms. 

I prefer the quiet since being yelled at by customers constantly gives me quite the headache, and im pretty introverted normally so I quite enjoy break time. The break room I prefer to use is labled as ""room A"" and its where my and a few others lockers are located. 

Okay now, I was enjoying my break as normal and my co-worker Selly walked in to grab something from their locker, shortly after their phone rang and they took the call. They were in this call for only about 2 minutes, and it didn't sound like they were gonna end it anytime soon, so I moved to break room B. This wasnt out of malice or anything, I just like my peace and quiet.  

The next day I noticed the stickynote that labled my locker was missing, I assumed it fell off, put a new one on it, and went to start my day. Break time hits and theres someone in room A so I go to room B and thats when I found my old stickynote on a random unused locker. I was confused and asked the guy that was in room A if he knew who moved it and why. He said ""Oh Selly moved it because he thought you were going to move lockers anyway."" This answer was very confusing so I went and found Selly to ask him myself if he was the one who moved it and why. 

After I asked he said ""Oh I thought you wanted a room to yourself since you so rudely left room A when I walked in for only a moment"". I told him that me leaving had nothing to do with him, and that I just liked the quiet, but his response was something like ""well now you can have all the peace and quiet you want"" and got into his car before I could respond.  

He seemed really mad, and honestly I just want to know if I really did do something wrong. I dont always catch if im being rude so maybe I really am the asshole here, thus I wrote this post to find out. 

Edit: I didn't expect this post to blow up, hahah... thank you for your comments everyone! I will be talking to HR tomorrow about the situation.

1k6clcy,WIBTA for not going to a friends wedding because I didn't get invited to the reception?,"I (27F) got invited to a friend's (27F) wedding. I wasn't expecting an invite, as we only know each other because I went to high school with her childhood friends and we all started hanging out together in high school and throughout university. We usually see each other once a year, sometimes twice, and we have a pretty active group chat.

The wedding would require quite a bit of travel, either a $700 flight or a 16 hour car ride. I don't have much vacation time left, but I was willing to use it and make the wedding part of a longer vacation. The invite that I was sent only listed information for the ceremony and refreshments afterwards, and I assumed that there would be no reception, which would be a little strange but also cheaper (which is understandable, life is expensive).

The other night I was messaging one of the other girls in the friend group (also 27F) to ask if she was going, as I didn't want to be the only one in our friend group there (except for the bride, we all live within an hour of each other and would all have to travel to the wedding). We chatted about how expensive it would be, some different options for travel, and that was it.

Today I got a message from the bride. She informed me that our mutual friend had mentioned that it might be a good idea to clarify with me that they are keeping the reception very small. Because of this, she only invited the 3 other people in our friend group to the reception, and not me. While I do understand that weddings are expensive, and I'm not one of her closest friends, I'm upset that she singled me out by only inviting me to half the event and didn't feel the need to tell me until someone else mentioned it to her. She did say that if enough people RSVP'd 'no' she could maybe fit me into the reception. Which is nice, but also feels like a pity invite.

I am glad to find out now, instead of after spending a lot of money to go to a wedding and then be ditched by my friends for a reception I'm not welcome at. I honestly would have preferred she not invite me at all, instead of labelling me as a ""tier 2"" friend. Before I found out about the reception, I thought that if I had decided not to go I would still buy the couple a gift to be nice. But now I really don't want to go, and I definitely don't want to send a gift.

1k6acod,AITA for not letting my sister come to a gig-work shift with me?,"TW: mentions of medical issues, surgery

Background: I (20f) have been undergoing diagnostic evaluation for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) after having 2-3 severe cardiac events in 1 week back in January. I was medically separated from my patient-facing job (I worked as a patient care tech) 2 weeks after my first event after my doctors wanted me to wait for further testing before going back to work. I was released to still drive and didn’t have any lifting restrictions, and was told to just keep an eye on my rate and try to take it easy as much as possible. I’m a college student. I began doing DoorDash around that time to try and continue to make ends meet. Starting after that and up to now, my parents have been almost 100% supporting me aside from my car note and a loan payment that I’m responsible for. My sister (19f, also a college student at the same college as me) left her job around the same time I was medically separated from mine because she was unhappy with her position (team member at a fast food restaurant (I and my family worked in food for so long, so we held no ill feelings towards her, just as long as she had a job). My parents supported this, so long as she actively sought out another position while she also did DoorDash. This didn’t happen.
I ended up experiencing other medical complications (emergency surgery and a hospital stay) that prevented me from getting a non gig-work job due to weight lifting restrictions during my 6 week recovery. Closer to the end of that 6 weeks, I picked up an opportunity on Walmart Spark to make ends meet a bit better (at least taking care of my food, etc, but without paying anything to my parents. I realize this might make me an AH, to them, for a different reason than this post) than with DoorDash. Just after being medically cleared to lift as normal, I applied for and accepted an offer for a non patient-facing position at a local hospital near my hometown, and I’m supposed to start in a week and a half once we move after the semester ends.
Yesterday, my parents had a serious conversation with us and said they could no longer assist us with our bills, and that we needed to pay our portion by May 10th. My sister has applied for Walmart Spark, but is currently waitlisted and can’t get in. Her benefits on doordash only allow her to dash during a scheduled time period, during which offers are not guaranteed. She asked me today if she could come with me for my Spark block tonight and split some of the money I make with her. I’m currently in a pinch because i haven’t paid my car note or loan payment for this month yet (a total of $455, I notified my credit union as soon as I knew I’d be late due to medical/financial hardship), and I have to have that paid by next Wednesday. Because of this, I had to decline. She is upset because she said she needs money for “something”, she didn’t specify what. I understand her position but I also know I need to take care of my bills first.

1k69ed9,AITA for deciding to stop talking and not finish the story I was telling my mom after being interrupted again?,"So this might be a minor issue but id like some completely unbiased opinions. 

My mom (56F) and I (25f) have a great relationship, ya we fight sometimes like everyone but on the average we are truly good and id say pretty close.

Having said this we just had a small fight, what happened was I recently read into the new advances happening in technology in the field of genetics and that lead me to cloning etc. Just genuinely interesting and provoking science, so I just wanted to share with her the discoveries and talk about it. So I waited until the time when she is free and on her phone, when we usually hang out together in the living room both doing our own things and started to tell her. Just as I was getting into it, she interrupted me to say my mobile was charging too close to me and to put it far away (cause of radiation). Now normally this wouldn't be a big deal but this exact situation where me or my brother (30 M) would be telling her a story and just as we were getting invested in it, she would interrupt by saying something completely irrelevant and usually just to tell us to do a quick thing; fix t-shirt, comb hair, push a cup from the edge of the table, you get it. Both me and my brother find this incredibly annoying and we would tell her don't do this, it just completely takes the wind out of our sails, makes us feel like she isn't listening and doesn't care. This happened like more than 20 times throughout the years and she sometimes still does it. So this time I got very frustrated told her you did it again just why do you always do this. In her defense she was listening she told me the exact last sentence I said and said okay continue I'm listening. But I just didnt feel like talking anymore tbh, so I told her nah whatever doesnt matter anymore even after she said no continue I didnt and then she said that I am overreacting and that she was listening she said just this quick little thing but she's paying attention. I didnt care anymore and said okay Im done and then the situation ended.

Now I just wanna say I love her and will always appreciate and be grateful to her, I genuinely can't imagine my life without her, even with all her sometimes overbearing and overprotective behaviour.

I say this because I want to make it clear I am not insanely angry right now where I just cant stand her or think clearly, Im very clear headed but I still feel like I'm not sure if i am over reacting.

1k692rt,AITA - for not disclosing club team opportunity to friends family?,"Back story: We have been friends with this family for couple years, they have kids our kids ages and our oldest plays on volleyball team with theirs. We share driving duties to practice and other things - it's good relationship.

Last week Sunday (4/13) my child tried out for a club team that we told them about, they tried out as well and invited another family to try out too. Great. The next day I wrote our current coach about said club. He said it was fine but suggested our child try this club we had previously tried out for, and offered to introduce us to coaches.

This setoff a complicated timeline for us, we had 1 week from 4/14 to accept the offer from Club 1 ( lower ranked and a combined age team) or try for Club 2( higher ranked and better organization). We initially told our friends we were going to join Club 1 but didn't really know for sure, nor could we really share the info about coach recommending our child. I requested an extension from club 1, an additional week and got it. 

Club 2 didn't get in touch until after initial timeline had elapsed and other family signed up for Club 1. At this point I told the family that we had this evaluation with the club 2 team next week and we were waiting to decide until then. They were a little upset but not sure how we could have managed this better. I would love for them to get on this other team but I can't ask coaches to add another kid, it wasn't my invite/position anyway. 

I never intended for this situation to go this way, and wasn't fishing for an invite or trying to get special recommendation for our child on Club 2.

1k692fm,AITA for refusing to look at grad photos?,"So I'm graduating in June from hs and my parents wanted to do stuff to celebrate. I really don't like attention at all, but when I said I didn't want a party/photos (and I think I was polite about it, I just stated that I didn't want it) they said ""it's not for you, it's for us to enjoy look back on"" and so I took that into consideration and said ""well, it's not for me, it's a favor for my parents and since they do so much for me, they deserve it"". So I took the photos, gave input on the party when it was asked of me, etc.

A little bit about me is that I'm clinically depressed. A large chunk of that comes from my appearance (body dysmorphia). As in, if I see even one photo of myself it completely ruins my day. Let alone like a hundred, which would probably ruin my week. The feeling never really wears off completely, either. It'll linger in my mind. My parents know this as I've made it abundantly clear I do not want to see any photos they take of me, ever (at least nothing past the age of 6-7). I can look in the mirror and feel okay, and especially if I have to get dressed up for something (i.e. Prom) I'd rather never see the pictures, because if I feel good abt how I look at the time, and I look back and see what I actually looked like, it ruins the whole experience for me and I can't appreciate it anymore. **I AM WORKING ON IT, BUT IT TAKES TIME,** just to clarify.

Thursday, my mother texts me and says that sometime this week we need to go to the photographer's studio to look at the pictures she took of me. I said, and I quote, ""I don't have to go to that do I"", to which she blew up at me, accusing me of never letting her ""have a moment"" and told me to do it all with my dad because ""he's so great"". She's been icing me out for almost a week now, and strangely, I don't really mind it. I'm less stressed out now lol. I just thought I didn't have to go because the pictures weren't for me, they're for my parents.

**Be honest, am I just an ungrateful brat, or am I valid in this? lol**

TLDR: my parents made me take grad photos and my mother is very angry at me for not wanting to see them, even though it was the common sentiment that they weren't for me, they were for them, so they can pick the ones they like. I have a clinical issue with looking at photos (they make me severely self-conscious and depressed)

1k68xvm,AITA for not caring?,"Last night I was typing on my PC, like journaling but instead on a doc. My mom was taking my little brother to a baseball game, and I had about 2 hours of alone time, so I figured that would be something to do. While I was writing I wrote about empaths and my mom’s history of drinking and how I listen to her have s3x every night. Then my dad called to talk to me, I left my PC on and told myself,”well I’ll come back and turn it off,” but my mom came home soon after that. My PC is in the back room before the laundry room, so my mom had to go in there, and my PC was still on. So she read what I put. I didn’t say anything about how I hated her or how she’s an awful mom, I truly don’t think that. But I did put that  the things she did and is still doing does in fact affect me. She got angry at me, and told me that I hate her, and I think she’s an awful mother, and I should never have written any of that. Then said “well if you think I drink all the time, and you hear me f7ck every night, and I’m such a bad mom, then you can have her,” she then proceeded to get drunk last night and her AND her boyfriend were loud when they f7cked. I didn’t tell her I was sorry, though. I told her “those were my thoughts.” And she was heavily offended by that. She said “you’re not even apologetic, those are your thoughts and that’s that.” But she’s not wrong.

1k68mgy,AITA for yelling at my sibling for filming instead of helping.,"So this evening my cat brought a live rabbit into the house. Cue chaos, running round with a box to try and catch the rabbit and get it out of the house. My mum and I are trying to guide the rabbit out the door and my sibling (21 btw)... stood with their phone filming it. I asked them to stop because they were in the way and I was trying to move around to stop the rabbit getting in the sitting room.

It does, and manages to get all the way across the room before I put the box over it. We try to figure how to get it from the box to the outside. We decide throwing a towel over it is the best way to go. I get ready and say ""maybe someone should stand behind me just in case"" and then look over and they're yet again filming. I tell them to stop because it's not helping to which they say ""well what else am I suppose to do.""

At this point, I'm really annoyed from the adrenaline and general malarky of it all and raise my voice, saying ""NOT FILM IT."" They say back ""fine, you don't have to yell it's not like I could do anything else.""  
We catch the rabbit, get it out of the house and my sibling has flounced upstairs where they are sulking,

Mum says I should go up to apologise. I do to keep the peace but like I am really the bad guy here? Like to me being annoyed I have to ask them multiple times to stop filming in a pretty stressful situation is fairly reasonable.",AmItheAsshole,DaisyDays264,57,0.91,24,2025-04-23 19:53:13+00:00,Not the A-hole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k68mgy/aita_for_yelling_at_my_sibling_for_filming/,True,Not the A-hole
1k68i6w,AITA for not including someone in an invite to a kid’s birthday party?,"There was a small birthday gathering for a young family member recently. I wasn’t the host, but I was allowed to invite a close friend. The host—another family member—agreed to let me extend the invitation mainly to avoid hurting my friend’s feelings, even though they haven’t really spoken in quite a while and aren’t close.

However, the host made it clear that they did not want my friend’s partner there. There’s a past incident involving the partner that left the host feeling disrespected. It wasn’t a simple awkward moment—it was significant enough that the host still feels uncomfortable around them. And there’s never been any kind of acknowledgment or apology.

Other mutuals were invited, but they have an actual relationship with the host. My friend and their partner don’t. Out of respect for the host’s wishes, I only invited my friend.

When they found out their partner wasn’t included, they chose not to attend. That turned into a full-blown argument, and now we’re not speaking.

I genuinely didn’t want to cause drama—I just didn’t feel right pushing against the boundaries set by the host, especially when it wasn’t my event. But now I’m being treated like I was rude or inconsiderate.

AITA?

Edit: the host and the friend were on good terms and would hang out in the past with myself included. there wasn’t an official falling out between them but they have not hung out since the incident with the partner. the host doesn’t dislike the friend. 

Edit #2: The Host and I have come to an understanding that invitations to “friends” should be more so based on the connection shared now between friends vs the connection in the past that sizzled out. 

Unfortunately, I feel like feelings would have been hurt either way if the friend was left out or included. But it’s just a part of growing up and drifting away. Thanks all!

1k67p2x,AITA for not having my sister come on the bachelorette party when she was a bridesmaid?,"I (31F) had my sister (23F) in my wedding party back in 2017. When my husb& & I were getting things in order for choosing people to have in our bridal party I contacted my sister (16 at the time) about being part of it as we are very close. I explained that I would like for her to be a bridesmaid & not the MOH only due to how young she was & not wanting to stress her out in anyway (emotional or financial). I made sure she was ok with this before contacting the others I wanted to be in the bridal party.

My MOH planned a bachelorette party for me with a nice dinner, followed by an escape room & a private room at a karaoke bar. She had already reserved the room at the bar & if she cancelled she would not have gotten part of her money back. Another thing to understand is all of my bridesmaid except my sister were in the same location; my sister was 2 hours away. After being told about the plan I called my sister & explained it to her. I said she could come up & stay in the spare room at my apartment, but would not be able to go to the bar because of her age. I gave her the option of either doing that OR I come down one weekend & we go on a girl's trip to wherever on my dime. She chose the latter saying she understood & was ok with the arrangement. I had the bachelorette party & it was a blast. True to my word I went down the next month & my sister & I went out of town to go shopping & spend the weekend together.

Fast forward to late last year when my sister got engaged to the sweetest guy. I was ecstatic for them & proud of the woman my sister had become. I got the invite to be part of the bridesmaid party, which I was honored by, but she did not have me be the MOH. This honestly did not bother me as she is entitled to having whoever she wants in the party & the role they play. About a month ago I got some pictures from my mom of my sister & her other bridesmaids. She told me that I missed a great bachelorette party & that it was upsetting I couldn't come because of work commitments. I told her I had no idea what she was talking about. I was informed that my sister had told our parents that I declined to come to the bachelorette party because I was traveling for work. I called my sister & asked why she didn't tell me about the bachelorette party & lied to our parents. She said that it was to put me in my place for not changing my bachelorette party plans to be able to include her & for not making her MOH at my wedding.

I was shocked. I thought that we had gotten passed this & she had been ok with all the choices & accommodations, but apparently she had been deeply hurt about her not being my MOH & including her at the bachelorette party.

So Reddit AITA for not having my sister as my MOH & not having my actual MOH change the bachelorette party plans so she could attend the whole thing? I understand it is in the past & it can't be changed, but now I feel incredibly guilty for not choosing her as the MOH & changing the party plans at that time.",AmItheAsshole,Dr-Wh0-Lov3r,98,0.85,153,2025-04-23 19:15:17+00:00,Not the A-hole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k67p2x/aita_for_not_having_my_sister_come_on_the/,True,Not the A-hole
1k64lld,AITA for leaving a friend's birthday party after falsely being accused of stealing?,"Recently a really close friend of mine, Tyler(M27) had a birthday so me(M26) and another close friend Andrew(M24) threw a little get together for Tyler. It wasn't anything crazy we just went out for some drinks and dinner. It was about 3 hours into the night, we had already ate, walked around the city a bit, and after we were drinking beers by my car after having just smoked a joint. I asked Andrew if I could hit his vape and he realized he didn't have it on him so we went back to Tyler's car to see if he had left it there (Tyler picked up Andrew). 

The whole way to Tyler's car, Andrew is asking me if I have his vape (I do not). When we get to Tyler's car and Andrew doesn't find his vape he asks me again if I have it and so I ask him if he thinks I stole it. He tells me yes and I tell him I don't have it and that he probably left it somewhere or it fell out of his pocket. I don't think he believed me but we both kind of let it go but the vibe has definitely changed at this point. I don't appreciate being accused of stealing and I will admit I was probably visibly upset but I didn't blow up or anything. We went to a club to try to salvage the night and while we were walking up the steps to the club, Andrew's wallet literally falls out of his pocket and I just hand it back to him and say ""you dropped this"". I left shortly after we got to the club because I just wasn't feeling it anymore.

The next day Tyler sent me a text saying that I was a jerk for leaving his birthday. I just feel like his anger is misplaced. Shouldn't you be more upset with Andrew for killing the vibe?

1k62d9x,AITA for not inviting my husband on a “family” trip?,"I have 4 sisters and 1 brother. My father won a trip to a Montana dude ranch at an auction … we all life in Texas. He said we all should go. Husband and I had dinner, just the three of us, when Dad told us about it. Husband immediately chimed in “oh we can’t do that!” Dad looked a little surprised. Meanwhile, my eldest sister and her family are going. She sent a private text to us other sisters asking us to “PLEASE COME! We will make it a girls trip”… even though her hubby, and adult son with fiancé are going. Two sisters said “I’m in!” … now I want to go, and have airplane points to fly. So I told my hubby I’m going, to which he gave a “hmmmm”. 
At Sunday lunch, my eldest sister brought it up, that it’s a “Girls Trip, with the addition of my husband, son and his male friend from Montana, and his fiancé will join the girls!” 

So my nephew at the table questioned “Uncle Frank, aren’t you coming? It will be fun!” Hubby said very curtly “Well APPARENTLY it’s a ‘Girls Trip’ and I wasn’t invited!” and he elbowed me and has been giving me the silent treatment since. 

Hubby goes on every trip my father pays for. I just want some sister time. Hubby and I went to California last fall for our 30 year anniversary. I’d really just like one trip with my sisters… am I the asshole??????

Context: we will be in a 3 bedroom cabin and I’ll be sharing a bed with a sister. Some people already will be on the couch or even the floor. 

UPDATE: I want to genuinely thank you all for your constructive comments. As some have noted, I have been a doormat for a large portion of this marriage. Seven years ago, I went back to college and got the degree. I finally wanted. My husband has seen a change in me, that has benefited me, but not so much him. Through all of the frustrations, ups and downs of life, our marriage is worth saving, but with changes. Since my mother passed away in 2023, I have been much more assertive about the changes that I need to see. Our marriage garden needs tending, but at least it’s not overgrown with weeds anymore. I will not be going on the trip. Not because of the issues in this post, but our youngest son just announced he is proposing to his girlfriend the same weekend as the trip. I will be attending the proposal, and Hubby has been invited, and I hope he attends as well. 🤣🤣🤣 OTHERWISE I will be giving HIM an elbow!

1k61svc,AITA for informing my cousins about my uncle's death?,"Throwaway since my main is known.

My dad and his brother, my uncle Al, have a habit of telling others exactly two things about family situations: Jack and Poop. When my grandmother was very sick, no one in the family was told until AFTER she died. Same for my aunts. Meanwhile, Al and dad knew for weeks. The children of one of those aunts were among those not told. They understandably went LC with my dad and Al after that.

Recently, dad and Al's brother, Bob, ended up in the hospital, very sick. It turns out that he had a very aggressive form of cancer that had already spread throughout his body. We were told to let family know ASAP, as he was given a week or two to live.

My dad and Al let me and my brother (who lives across the country) know what was going on. However, I was forbidden from telling my paternal cousins. They had kept in some contact with Bob, and were worried that they hadn't heard from him.

I told them anyway. I felt they deserved to know what was happening, even if being with him wasn't possible. I kept it strictly to the facts, and just asked them not to tell my dad and Al. They appreciated the updates, and there's been no drama.

Now that he's gone, it's already been decided that there will be no funeral. However, there will be a memorial service in June. I asked my dad if the cousins will be at least invited to that.

I was told that since they weren't present while he was dying, they didn't deserve to be at the memorial. When I pointed out that they weren't TOLD Bob was dying, I was threatened with not being invited either. This makes me feel even more justified in telling them.

However, one of my friends is telling me I'm the AH for going behind my dad and Al's backs.

1k61nd9,AITA for telling a guy at the gym to be quieter,"I have been going to the same gym for nearly 6 years. It is a boutique gym in London. It is a wonderful place with a big enough gym floor, boxing rink, class rooms, versa rooms, a small spa and a juice bar. People are generally nice and respectful. 

At times, like in any gym, it can get busy. That’s fine and people have an unspoken system of sharing equipment, asking for it first. The other unspoken rule is, if you are doing heavy weight training, no dropping weights and no loud noises. Keep it classy.

The other day there was someone in there who clearly doesn’t subscribe to these notions. I unfortunately found out about it the hard way - while doing exercises I got totally startled by a loud drop of weights and a “aaaaghhhh” probably in the 80s of decibels, no joke. Another woman next to me saw my glance and rolled her eyes at the guy. Clearly I was not the only one who noticed. 

The action repeated, several times. Same noise, same disturbance. After a few minutes of this, I couldn’t take it any more, and I went to the guy and asked him to be quieter. He looked at me as if I’d asked him for his kidney and his first born child 😂 Said “sure” but then not much changed. 

The thing is, I get it if you are exercising vigorously you are bound to make some noise. We all do it. But if that noise obviously disturbs other paying members of the gym, you need to be more respectful and act accordingly. That’s my point of view.

1k601iv,"AITA for not sharing the ""good tea"" with a friend","My friend was over visiting, I offered tea. She said yes. 

She's not much of a tea drinker - she normally drinks cheap herbal teas (which are not Actually Tea anyway), and isn't picky. I, on the other hand, have a cabinet full of teas of various types, imported from around the world.

I offered her a decent selection: a nice oolong, a nice white tea, a high-quality herbal, a good flavored black. She pointed at something else in the cabinet and went ""what about that one?""

I hesitated, then said it's pretty expensive pu-erh I had imported, and she probably wouldn't like it anyway. She said I'm being stingy and could let her taste for herself.

But pu-erh is a polarizing tea anyway, and this stuff is not cheap at all, and it would be difficult for me to get more of this brand. I know I can make multiple cups from it, but I hadn't been planning on doing a pu-erh week right now, and really didn't want to ""waste"" it on someone who probably wouldn't like it anyway. She doesn't even like strong black tea!

(for those not in the know: my family has compared the smell of pu-erh to ""fish"" and ""dirty socks"". I like it a lot, but I understand it's not everybody's thing.)

1k5z37l,AITA for asking my mum to donate my own money?,"Is donating to charities a moral obligation?

I am a 16 year old who has saved up 4000 dollars, from work and birthday money. This money is kept by my mum. I am in no means well versed in philosophy but I have taken a keen interest and have been reading some works of philosophers regarding charitable giving, particularly the 'drowning child' thought experiment by Peter Singer (https://ethics.org.au/ethics-explainer-peter-singer-on-charitable-giving/), and I have always belied that donating money to charitable causes and allieviating suffering when practicable is a moral obligation. I plan to donate all of my four thousand dollars but I wish I could do it as soon as possible.

And thus I asked my mum if I could donate a hundred dollars this week to charity as I previously did and she broke down and told me that I was selfish for only thinking about my morals when I should save the money in case one day something happens and our family needs it. She told me that she did not approve of this and told me that I could donate when I was financially independent. I made her quite upset by requesting this donation and she cried but I genuinely believe that there are so many that are suffering due to causes that I could perhaps help with, even if it is a little and I think I am morally wrong for not doing so. I do not understand how donating a hundred dollars is something that she does not approve of when we spent upwards of a thousand dollars on non-necessities such as clothing, gifts and other items the other day. I thought she was quite selfish but she thinks the same for me and says I am ungrateful and she is sorry to have raised such a child.

TL;DR, I believe that it is a moral obligation to donate but my views clash with my mothers and I made her quite disappointed slash emotionally distressed from asking to donate some of my own money as a 16 year old, is this unreasonable?

1k5xps0,AITA for calling out my (F23) roommate (F24) for bringing her bf (M27) to stay over to our house without giving me even a heads up?,"Edit: for the people saying to split the cost in three, we couldn’t if we wanted to. This is a house owned by our university and you can’t live here unless you go to this uni, which her bf doesn’t. If someone wants to live with their partner, they need to apply to partnered housing which is an apartment or house for two people, but that means paying full price. 

I F23 share a house with a girl F24. My roommate when we first met told me her BF would come stay with her once a month from wed to sun. I was slightly annoyed since she didn’t even ask how I felt, but thought that overall it wasn’t that much and they are long distance so I said “fine”. 

However, as time passed it became a lot more than once month. What was even worse is that my roommate wouldnt even tell me “oh, my bf is coming some extra weeks this month” and I would just get out of the shower or something and suddenly they both would be there occupying all the space. 
My kitchen for instance is already very small. We only have basically a mini fridge for two people, and she always takes so much space. I eat out a lot because I don’t feel comfortable in my own kitchen. Luckily, I can afford to, but it bothers me. 

They sometimes leave tons of stuff dirty for an entire day which makes it practically impossible for me to cook. 

Furthermore, I had a really tough time last year. Four family members passed away. I moved to this new city in a different continent from home and I feel very alone and alienated. I had the worst depression I had in my life and I couldn’t even feel comfortable in my own home because a random person I don’t know and didn’t sign up to live with would constantly be there.

At some point, I had enough and told me roommate that at least she should tell me if her BF was going to stay so much here, so I can least plan ahead when I feel like I need to be alone. I mentioned that I also lived there and felt like I deserved knowing when a guest was going to stay for a long period of time. 

Her reply was “oh, well he stayed because blabla happened and also you brought someone once without telling me, so I assumed it was okay. But we won’t bother you anymore”.

Oh btw that “you brought someone once” meant that once I let a friend stay home for dinner, and then she stayed over in my room that night and left 8am the next day. Also that only happened once. Idk I think logically this is very difference from a person coming in our house and staying for several days several weeks a month. 

Well, now the BF is very rude to me, which has made the situation worse. He started coming less often, but now every time he comes it’s very uncomfortable. However, my roommate is starting to bring him more often now again.

1k5xh0m,AITAH for Parking in a public car park,"We moved last year into a house that has a public/residential car park. There’s no spaces marked out, no allocated parking. 
The car park is right next to our garden, when we first moved in, I did wait to see if there was parking space, so I parked on the front for a few weeks, saw there was plenty of space, so started using the car park. 

Somehow this has rubbed one of the neighbours up the wrong way, we have two cars, they have two cars, there is plenty of room for all cars, and still space left. 

I have said morning to her, I get ignored. So now it’s just awkward if we are both using the car park at the same time. 
It seems to me, that they like to have certain spaces, but as there is no markings, we just park in whatever space is available, if there’s no cars there, then we just park at one end and cars just park along side the next and so on. Kinda a first come first served basis.

With the car park being next to our garden, I feel awkward being on the garden and they pull up or leave. 
I’ve even got her on cctv complaining about the parking, but I’m really not sure what we’ve done wrong.
Are we the arseholes? Should we park somewhere else? Should I apologise? I don’t like upsetting anyone, and it sets my anxiety off. All the other neighbours are fine, say morning and so on.

1k5w3e6,WIBTA if I didn't tell my step family what we was planning on doing with my dad's ashes?,"So this will require some backstory first. My dad died around 5 years ago this June. 

At first everyone was there for each other but when me and my siblings started wanting to get involved with helping with the funeral/wake plans, processing and understanding the will and sorting out his belongings and what my step mum wanted to do with them. A couple weeks after the funeral we was turned on.

We was accused of never spending any time with him, we was accused of being money grabbing, showing our true colours etc etc. This mainly come from the Step mum and not the step kids but there excuse was she is grieving and backed her up. 

All we wanted to do was help with our dad's funeral and everything else that comes with it but instead it was flipped on its head and no matter what we said it was turned agasint us. Really I just wanted my dad back. I didn't want or need what was happening.

 Eventually we sat down with the step mum only as none of the kids wanted to be involved. She lost it at us and I didn't keep my cool either. We left that meeting with her confessing she never liked us and never wanted to see us again.

This sent me spirally into a further into a depression. More than I already was with loosing my dad but now I lost a big chunk of family. None of them contacted me after this point and if I did bump into them they would just say ""I'm so sorry how it turned out"" and would act all sheepish.

Now the step mum kept the ashes the whole way through this and after some convincing allowed us a small portion of him for our own. A couple months I got a text from my step sister saying my step mum wanted to give me the ashes as she thinks we should decide what to do with them. 

I thought that's amazing we can get them back but looking deeper into the text she never said ""and let us know what you do with them as we would like to be there"". This sort of stung. I know a year or two after he died she already moved on and to make matters worse she took that man on a holiday my dad planned with my dad's friends. 

Once we get them from my step sister I opened them to realise they are still in the same box we got from the crematorium which was falling apart and upon looking at his ashes they were rock solid. My heart sunk. She hadn't cared for him. I contacted my step sister to explain this and didn't get much back other then a half hearted sorry and some suggestions I had already considered as they were not scatterable.

Me, my siblings and a few other close people to my dad have decided to do an ashes bury in a green cemetery near where we all live. Everyone has said ""don't tell them what we are doing. They didn't care for you or your siblings. If they reach out tell them""

But for me and my conscious I am not sure I can do it. I am so conflicted as they were horrible to me and my family and on the other hand it just doesn't feel right to hold that back from them.

So WIBTA if I didn't tell them what we was planning on doing with his ashes? ",AmItheAsshole,Bitter_Emergency3143,292,0.92,61,2025-04-23 10:47:31+00:00,Not the A-hole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k5w3e6/wibta_if_i_didnt_tell_my_step_family_what_we_was/,True,Not the A-hole
1k5vvei,AITA Bf thinks it’s rude that I speak Spanish with my family while he’s there,"My (22f) boyfriend (26m) has barely talked to me since Easter because I was speaking in Spanish with my family. Long story short, his family is beyond dysfunctional right now so he came with me to see basically my mom’s entire side of the family for Easter. Everyone was mostly welcoming to him and spoke in English when addressing him but spoke in Spanish with me since it’s most of their first language. I noticed him getting quiet and going on his phone the entire time and barely speaking to me or anyone else. I had family members asking me if he was ok which is already embarrassing, and when I tried to ask what was wrong he basically told me to live him alone, which I did bc I wasn’t about to not spend time with my family who most of them I barely see outside of holidays. At one point he disappeared completely and was apparently outside FaceTiming his friend. On the way back we got into it when I asked him about it and he said that it made him uncomfortable that I was speaking mostly Spanish and not “including him”. Which isn’t true at all because multiple times I translated for him and switched between English and Spanish. He also said I was flirting with a family friend that I grew up with that I haven’t seen in like 10+ years and that I was wrong to give them my instagram. Mind u, this is a literal GIRL. Like someone I saw as a sister growing up. I don’t understand how u can say I’m flirting in the first place if u can’t understand what I’m saying, and second I wasn’t at all and everyone else knew that. We got into a big argument at my house and he left after we both took time off of work Monday and yesterday to spend together. At this point I genuinely want to know if I was wrong, like I understand that he wanted to feel included, but it’s not my fault that my entire family isnt 100% fluent in English. It just feels very controlling and insecure to me. But I’m in the wrong lmk 

Update: thank u if u left a helpful comment. A lot of people think that im wrong so i apologized and im still waiting for a response.
Also please stop downvoting everything. I get it, i was wrong. ",AmItheAsshole,firelordlindsay,40,0.67,198,2025-04-23 10:33:07+00:00,Not the A-hole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k5vvei/aita_bf_thinks_its_rude_that_i_speak_spanish_with/,True,Not the A-hole
1k5vj6z,AITA for denying my wife a puppy?,"**My wife (30 yo woman) and I (31 yo man) have been together for 11 years, and we got married almost 3 years ago. Last year, we decided that we wanted to try to have a child together. So we were very happy when, a few months later, we found out we were expecting. Unfortunately, the pregnancy ended in a miscarriage, which was very difficult for both of us, but we got through it together.**

**Shortly after, we put ourselves on a waiting list to adopt a dog. We both love animals and had always wanted to have a dog together.**

**A few months went by, and we received the news that we were pregnant again. This pregnancy seems to be going better, and we are expecting the baby in October. Around the same time, we also found out that a new litter of puppies would be born soon and that we had been selected to adopt one. The puppy is expected to be born in June, which means we could bring it home in August or September.**

**I told my wife that I wasn’t comfortable with the idea of training a puppy at the same time we’re having a baby. We both have busy jobs and active social lives, and I just don’t see how we can manage raising a dog while also adjusting to parenthood. Don’t get me wrong, I still want to adopt a dog — but I’d prefer to wait a few months or even years until we’ve settled into life with our baby.**

**My wife dismissed these concerns and said we’d be able to handle it. Shortly after, she even sent a message to the breeder saying that we were still very interested in adopting a puppy.**

**We’ve now reached the point where we’re starting to tell our friends and family that we’re expecting. We’ve received lots of excited congratulations, but also questions about how we’re going to juggle our busy lives with both a baby and a puppy. Whenever I’m asked this, I say that it’s also a concern of mine, but that my wife is determined to get a puppy now, while I’d prefer to wait.**

**Twice now, in response to this, my wife has said that she would choose a puppy over a baby. The first time, I laughed it off as a joke. But when she said it again in front of my family, I reacted angrily. I found it incredibly disrespectful to our unborn child.**

**On the way home, I told my wife that I thought she was being very selfish and that, at this point, I no longer want to adopt a dog — at least not until after the birth of our child. This has since led to quite a bit of arguing and tears.

1k5v6k3,AITA for telling a guy at my gym he’s a creep and needs to change somewhere else,"At the gym I go to, the men’s and women’s locker room entrances are side by side. The women’s door stays shut, but typically the men’s stays open, simply because the actual changing area is tucked away. There are lockers by the door but no one uses them because they are far from where people change, and people can easily see you if you use those front lockers and the door is open. There is one guy I see most days that changes (gets fully naked) and uses the lockers by the door. He’s the only person I’ve ever seen use those lockers and obviously the only person I’ve seen change there. I’ve never cared too much just thought he was weird. Until yesterday, my girlfriend told me as she was entering the women’s locker room she made eye contact with that guy since the door was open and he was practically standing in the doorway (technically in the locker room, yes), he was fully naked, and smiled and waved at her.

I immediately went to the locker room and got pretty pissed at him and told him to “stop using those fucking lockers you creep”. We exchanged some words but boiled down to him saying he can change wherever and me saying yes but why in front of the door? He then reported me. I was told he has been brought to their attention before but since he is at a locker and in the locker room they can’t really tell him to stop. And that I should just let it be and there is no reason to be angry.

One detail, this is in a European country that is fine with nudity. So am I! But not when he’s basically just flashing women going into their space.

So my question is, AITA for calling this guy out?",AmItheAsshole,trich1887,2609,0.94,271,2025-04-23 09:47:40+00:00,Not the A-hole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k5v6k3/aita_for_telling_a_guy_at_my_gym_hes_a_creep_and/,True,Not the A-hole
1k5u69m,AITA for expecting my friends to exclude a couple who spread false rumours about me being a home wrecker?,"I (34F) have been part of a lovely friend circle for a while. one of the guys in our group (let’s call him Anton) got a new girlfriend (let’s call her Molly). At first, everything seemed fine, but later, things got weird.

Apparently, Molly started believing I was trying to seduce Anton. This was completely untrue (actually our friends tried to match us previously with no success). Everyone knows Molly has insecurities from past relationships and has projected similar suspicions onto many other women.

Things escalated when the rumour spread accusing me of being a nasty person, home wrecker, etc.

The worst part was the conversation the couple decided to have with me when they felt that our friends start disliking this whole situation. They sat me down and basically told me that I had been inappropriate, “seductive,” and I should stop. I was in shock, freeze, and couldn’t respond properly at the time. (Just a note, we are in a liberal European country, and not some cult where women are not allowed to talk to men :D )

What confused and hurt me most is that Anton had been telling other friends that he didn’t think I’d done anything wrong, and that Molly was just having a hard time emotionally. But when we spoke directly, he sided with her completely. Later he also changed the narrative for friends too, saying he needs to be supportive of his partner.

Since then, I haven’t felt safe around them, I freeze completely. They still show up to group events and act like everything’s normal, but I don’t feel comfortable. I’ve kept my distance but haven’t made a big deal out of it. Still, I feel stuck—like I’m being forced to share space with people who blamed and shamed me unfairly and never took responsibility for it.

I know in theory it might help to talk to them to express how I feel but I freeze and am not able to. I am realising this was actually a traumatic experience, and now I have decided priority is looking after my nervous system, avoiding them completely and doing a variety of things to heal it.

I recently have shared this with a few girlfriends in the circle but my pain wasn’t really accepted. They dismissed it saying I should just talk to them. They didn’t like the idea that in order to protect my healing I will have to step down from anywhere they are attending. This puts people in an uncomfortable situation where they have to choose who to invite to their events.

I really do not understand how someone can be friends with people who did something so nasty. I wouldn’t stay in touch with someone who did something like this to my friend. At the same time, I am so close to many people in the circle, we have been through so much, they are like family, and we have so many values and beliefs in common.

So… AITA? Is my trauma making this look like a big deal while in reality this is not an issue and I should just brush it off and be friends with everyone?

EDIT: I don't really expect anyone to exclude them, this was a reddit push to a divisive wording. What I probably expect is them being understanding with me excluding myself from events where the couple is present but that's a bit longer and less clear wording. Although I personally wouldn't be friends with someone who did this to my friends so this value clash is confusing to me and making me feel unsafe in the whole friendship group.",AmItheAsshole,Rude-Examination-636,1413,0.93,154,2025-04-23 08:34:46+00:00,Not the A-hole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k5u69m/aita_for_expecting_my_friends_to_exclude_a_couple/,True,Not the A-hole
1k5twji,AITA For not defending my cousin actions for our groupings?,"For context me and my cousin were in the same course and class this school year and before I was even in her class, she was telling me that most of her classmates are very toxic and somewhat immature so I prepared myself for that thing because I don’t want my academic suffer just because of a conflict. Fast forward - we have a final project for our major subject which requires 5 or more people to do. So the members of the groups are me 20 F, Justine (20)F, Nikko James(20)M and other 2 members.  We have a 2 months preparation for our project which only takes atleast 1 week to complete and since it’s our midterm exam we are very exhausted from the exam and other stuff. The next week after our midterm exams is holy week which means that most of our classmates are in the province, excluding me since I was here in Manila. After holy week Justine messaged me saying that she already made a Final project and she’s going to ask our instructor to proofread our project. Then I asked her why she didn’t inform us that she was going to do our project alone? Then she said that she got bored and doesn’t do anything so she decided to just do our projects alone. So I tell here that our other group mates might have any other idea or suggestions about our projects that they want to include in our project, she says nothing. So when she announce in our group chat that she already had the project done Nj was mad because she did something without informing us and I agree with NJ, Justine make us look like we don’t have any participation in our project. So I asked Justine to say sorry about it and she did but she was still claiming that she did nothing wrong and was trying to help and I said it is not fair for us to not inform us about doing our project because we are also part of it and some of us still have a idea on what we are planning to accomplish in out project. So she said ‘it was also unfair for me because i did all of that and I didn’t even receive a thank you from you. I still had a hard time doing that.’ And i said to her that we didn’t asked her to do it alone and she was the one who did not know what groupings are.

1k5tesp,WIBTA if I give my mother ultimatum that its either me or her boyfriend?,"My mother (47F) was a single mother my whole life. Working two to three jobs to provide for me (21F) so I could have normal life.

Two years ago, she started seeing this guy (57M). Lets call him Martin. Martin lives in a different city than my mom’s (1,5h drive). So she agreed that she will go there for weekends since I apparently won’t even notice she’s gone since I am usually preoccupied with my friends or my games.

Few months ago they decided that they are gonna buy a house since my mother doesn’t want to drive for so long. 

The main problem is - no one, not even me, has seen the guy. I don’t know who he is, how he looks, I just know his name, age and city where he’s from. And while I am making attempts to meet him, I am usually shut down by my mother that says that he doesn’t want to meet me or that he’s not ready, etc. 

I told my mother that she can move in with him but under one condition that he has to meet me. I’m not talking about him meeting the whole family (her sister is the golden child and everyone else is a looser) since she would faced a lot of judging from the family, but I am something else. Her daughter.

In my opinion, when he entered the relationship with my mother, he automatically entered relationship with me and that of being something like my step-father so he should have at least some courtesy to meet the child of the woman he fucks. 

I’m getting desperate. There is only one thing - I can give her ultimatum. Either me or him. Will I be the asshole if I give her ultimatum?

1k5sz1t,AITA for not giving my cousin my book to borrow?,"AITA for not letting my cousin borrow my book?

I (19F) have a younger cousin (16F) who has been wanting to borrow my book. Specifically, the new hunger games book that came out this month; I don't want to give it to her. I know this might sound a little silly, but I'll explain further.

I'm someone who likes collecting books, it's pretty much the only thing I'll waste money on. I always buy hardcovers, and I'll buy special edition books too if I like the cover etc. Which basically means I spend double or triple the amount I would if I was buying paperback. 

I've let my cousin borrow 3 books from me in the past. Two of them I didn't get them back at all, but I know she still has them because I've seen them when I go to her house. I let this slide because I figured it wasn't a big deal and I wasn't going to cause drama over nothing. Though I will mention that I did ask a couple of times over text when she would be done with them, so she knows they aren't hers to keep.

The third time she gave me the book back, but some of the pages had marker on them from her younger brother; but it was still readable so I just sucked it up and didn't say anything. 

This wouldn't be a big deal ordinarily, but I work part time as a full time college student. I have to pay for my student accommodation, and then any extra expenses on top of that such as food, toiletries etc. Then I usually give money to my mum for my younger sister. All this to say, buying these books is an expense for me, even if it wouldn't be for others - and even if it wasnt, I don't like the idea of giving away books that I know I won't get back (or will get ruined)

My cousin is a big fan of the hunger games, and has been asking since I bought the book if she could borrow it. She can't afford it since she doesn't work and her mum won't waste money on a £20 book (Roughly 25 dollars? There are no paperback editions of this book released yet.)

I basically told her flat out that I wasn't going to give her it because I couldn't trust she was going to take care of it or actually give me it back. She then said she would give me my other books if I let her borrow the new one. I still said my answer would be no because her brother might draw on it. She basically pleaded with me saying that the paperback wouldn't come out for months and that she really wanted to read it.

I got a text from my aunt not long after asking me nicely to let her borrow it, and that I was being petty by holding a grudge over something it; and that family were supposed to be kinder to eachother than that. To her credit, she wasn't arguing with me or anything, but she obviously thought I was in the wrong. 

I do feel guilty, but I just got this book and I can't afford to buy a new copy if she doesn't return it. I understand that she can't afford it, and that it's a book she's been looking forward to since it was announced; but that doesn't give her the right to keep it?? I don't know, I know this is silly lol

1k5sk4l,AITA for not playing with my bf and his friend?,"It all started when I just wanted to spend some quiet time gaming with my boyfriend. However, he insisted on inviting a friend to play with us — someone he knows intentionally irritates me, especially during the game. I told him multiple times that I didn’t want to play with him, but he kept insisting. I got upset and, eventually, said, “If you want to play with him, go ahead,” and left the game.

What really hurt was that after I left, my boyfriend didn’t reach out to check on me and immediately joined the call with his friend. Later, when I tried to move past it and play again, he brought up that there was an awkward vibe because I didn’t want to play with his friend. Then he mentioned that his friend asked if I was “being dramatic,” and he said “yes” — even though it was in a “joking” manner, it really stung.

I asked him if he agreed with his friend, and he said “yes.” That response hit me hard. I felt like my feelings were being dismissed, and my discomfort was being treated as a joke. I didn’t say much in that moment because I was hurt and didn’t want to say something I might regret.

What bothers me the most is that my boyfriend didn’t defend me in that situation. Instead of standing up for me or at least showing that my feelings mattered, he just laughed it off. And this isn’t the first time. I’ve expressed how I feel, and yet this keeps happening. It makes me question if my feelings are valid or if I’m just being too sensitive.

I don’t want to control who he plays with or be possessive. I just want to feel like I matter and that my feelings are taken seriously. When he doesn’t defend me, especially in front of others, I feel invisible and unimportant. I need him to understand that it’s not about the game — it’s about how I feel when he doesn’t have my back.

1k5sfho,AITA for expecting my housemate to apologise after she lied about me,"For context I (23f) live in a share house with my boyfriend (27m) and five others.

Last week my housemate Veruca (26f) came out in hives which she thinks are an allergic reaction to an insect bite. 
Her boyfriend Sid (26m), and the other couple Annie (26f) and Daniel (28m) all have bites on them too, although are completely different to Veruca's, and look and feel like mosquitos, which they get a lot smoking outside in the evenings. 

Veruca and Annie the bite were because the couch was infested with bugs. This seemed unlikely as neither me, or my boyfriend, had bites and my boyfriend had been sleeping on the couch for the last week due to a bad cough and not wanting to keep me awake. It seems unlikely that bugs would bite everyone but us.

I came home the next day and Veruca and Sid had turned the house upside down without consulting anybody. They removed everything from the common spaces, everything was outdoors or in random boxes. The kitchen was an absolute mess. There was no logic to the approach. 

The next morning my boyfriend was late to work as he couldn't find his toothbrush, toothpaste, or shampoo since they moved it. He sent a message asking them to return it, and they replied saying they had done their share and would be going to a festival.  Our share would be cleaning up the mess that they had made while they were away. 

I sent a message saying I'm happy to help clean, and that Veruca should go to the doctor and get her allergy checked so we know the cause and  can tackle it more logically.

(note: Veruca did go to the dr, but doesn't believe their diagnosis as it doesn't lend itself to a bug infestation). 

Veruca replied sending a super insuring message and making several false accusations about my behaviour to try and make me look bad to the other housemates & since then her and Sid have been attacking me for things I haven't said.

This isn't the first time this has happened: a few months ago we mentioned we had a friend interested in our spare room and Veruca and Sid responded by accusing us of stealing their food and saying that they therefore couldn't trust any of our friends. 
They knew we weren't stealing their food, as our other housemates (now moved out) had already admitted to taking the food. They just decide random narratives about us to suit their objective, and it's very hard to reason with. 

They went away to the festival for the weekend and have come back pretending nothing has happened and have sent a chore sheet for everyone to the GC. 

I've let everything go in the past to keep the peace, but this time  I've made it clear that I will not be engaging with either if them in any capacity until they apologise and acknowledge their behaviour.

They're refusing & think I'm being petty, and uncooperative. The rest of the housemates agree that the way in which they spoke to me was offensive and I deserve an apology. However Annie does think that I should be the bigger person and let it go to avoid further conflict.

1k5s7fs,AITA for telling my best friend her friendship with her coworker seems off?,"My best friend, who I'll call ""A"" (25F) and I (25F) have been friends for 16 years.

A is a very open lesbian, and for practically as long as I've known her, she's had a tendency to become infatuated with female friends or acquaintances almost immediately, which dominates our conversations. Occasionally it ends up in a relationship, but if it does, it's usually toxic. She started a new job in January, and in March, she had a proper conversation for the first time with her coworker, ""B"" (43F). Ever since, they've started hanging out consistently and have become very close. About a week ago, A called me to ask if I wanted to hang out the next week (two days ago, as of the time that I'm writing this).

Tangentially, she mentioned that it was the first day for the past three weeks that she and B hadn't hung out. I thought she meant on weekends, but she clarified that they ate lunch together at work, she helped take care of her three kids after school and in the evenings, and they hung out on the weekends. They cuddle, B sleeps with her head in her lap, all that. She also mentioned that B was the one to invite her to hang out on almost all of these occasions, and even said her coworkers brought it up to her boss because they thought the two were dating.

This is where I'm probably TA. Call me bitter, call me jealous; I probably am. But knowing A, I had a really weird gut feeling when she told me this piece of information. I told her that I was really happy that she was getting close with her coworker, and I was sure they got along very well, but there's something to be said about a 43 year old who has other coworkers her age that is actively pursuing the close friendship of someone much younger than her, especially so suddenly.

A immediately got angry and said ""it's not like that, she's probably not even into women, she keeps talking about this guy she used to be in love with."" She said I was insinuating that B was creepy and predatory, and that I didn't know what I was talking about. I didn't have the words at the time, but to me, it seemed very emotionally immature to immediately be that clingy with someone so much younger than you that you've known for such a short time.

I backpedaled and apologized, remarking I didn't mean what I said, and again, that I was happy she's found someone she gets along with so well. She gave me the silent treatment. A minute later, I said ""Well, I'll see you next week,"" and she said ""Yup,"" to which I hung up the call. 

I still can't tell if this is actually a bad situation waiting to happen, or if I'm just bitter and jealous about A having other close friends & I'm making a huge deal out of nothing. My mom said B probably just enjoys the free help with her kids. My boyfriend said it's super weird, A doesn't actually respect me, and I need better friends.

The night before we both stayed up to study for an upcoming finals. She lives in a different house so we studied together on call. But we decided to call it a day around 1am and went to sleep. 

Then during the sleep it started raining heavily with thunder. That was when she called me at around 4:30am because she was woken up by the thunder and can’t sleep. During the call she said she wanted to go to the toilet but she was scared of the thunder so I stayed on the call until she was done. For context, the rain was really really bad, like almost stormy thunders so it was loud.

After that, I said I was feeling tired and needed to sleep so I told her exactly that; I am tired. I suggested she could try earplugs to cover the thunder sounds so she could sleep better. Then after that, went to bed. This morning, when I woke up, I do regret how I treated her because it feels like I wasn’t there when she needed me.

They have been together just over a year, living together for maybe 6ish months at most. I knew their relationship was not great, but it wasn't my relationship, and it wasn't harmful or anything, so I let it be. Something to note about my friend is that she could be very pushy if she wants something. Little sister mentality basically.

Not even a week ago, they got into an argument where he told her that she pressured him into marriage, and that he's too young for marriage, and doesn't want to be married to someone who doesn't know what she's doing with her life.

We both already had a feeling she kind of pressured him into marriage, but didn't really wanna say anything because that would take admitting that a close friend is manipulative and a shit partner. We think he wants to break it off, but she won't take no for an answer. She also told our friend that she's with him because she doesn't want to be single. That's an issue in itself, because nobody deserves to be in a miserable marriage because the other strong-armed them into it for their own selfish reasons. I feel bad for him, even if I don't know him at all.

I didn't know they were back together until she dropped the bomb that they toured a house. IDK if it's just me, but I think that adding a house to an already unstable situation is quite possibly the stupidest thing someone can do. Just under having a kid to save a relationship, which I feel like she would also do, tbh. It wouldn't be that out of left field. I brought up wanting to talk to her and tell her that this is a bad idea to my coworker friend, who said I would be an asshole to meddle like that in someone else's business, but what is friendship if not being there for someone and knocking some sense into them from time to time? I feel bad about wanting to do it, but I also don't want her to make a stupid mistake because she likes the idea of getting married. So, WIBTA?

  
Edit: Thanks for the judgment. I think I'm gonna maybe let it be and see where it goes. Maybe they'll break up before the wedding, they probably won't even qualify for a house. I'll give her support when it crumbles and let her know that if there is another reason she's staying, we can help her. I'll give an update if anything else happens, but I don't wanna risk blowing up a friendship.",AmItheAsshole,PsychologicalMove596,263,0.91,81,2025-04-23 05:26:53+00:00,Not the A-hole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k5rime/wibta_if_i_talked_my_friend_out_of_getting/,True,Not the A-hole
1k5r39l,AITA for holding a grudge after a girl gifted my lost keychain to my friend,"This happened to me a while ago, but I can't get over it.

I (16F) used to have a cat keychain on my backpack. It wasn't anything too special, just a cute little crocheted cat head that I kept on my bag. A few weeks after getting it, I stayed after school to help keep tabs on a tennis game because it was required for an athletic training class I had. After I left the game and was going home, I realized that the keychain was no longer on my backpack. Later on I searched the area a bit for it but had no luck. Naturally, I was pretty bummed out but didn't pay it too much thought because things like this aren't that big of a deal.

That was until fast-forward to one of my friends' birthdays. We were hanging out before school, our other friends were wishing her a happy birthday, giving gifts, etc; when I noticed that one of the gifts that she received was MY cat keychain. At first I was confused, I thought that maybe it was a different keychain that maybe happened to look similar to mine. After further inspection though, I am 100% sure that it was indeed mine. (I know this for sure because when I lost it, I only lost the head of the cat but not the actual chain part, and low and behold, this keychain happened to be missing the chain. It also has the same dirt marks on it but the former reason mentioned way the main giveaway).

After questioning my friend about who gave it to her, I found out that my friend who we'll call N (also 16F) had been the one to do it. This made sense because I know that the area where I lost it also happens to be an area N frequents because she has classes there. Now, this is the part that really makes me upset: N claims that she bought it for my friend as a birthday present. I hate to interject, but let me interject, who the hell finds an item on the ground and thinks it's okay to gift it to someone while also lying about how they obtained it.

Obviously, this whole situation made me feel very frustrated because I didn't want to cause a scene and ask my friend for it back because it was now her birthday present. I also just feel sad that someone I knew actually found it but even then I wasn't able to get it back because they decided to give it to someone else. I ranted about this to my best friend (who's friends with N) but she kind of shrugged it off and basically said it wasn't that big of a deal, and I was being a hard on N when I couldn't technically confirm it was the same keychain.

Ever since this happened, I haven't talked to N. It's petty but I've basically resorted to ignoring her whenever she's around because of this situation. I've talked to other friends about this, and some have said that I should let it go and that it's unfair for me to treat her this way as this now happened a couple of months ago. I've tried to, but every time I see her I get a bad taste in my mouth and I still haven't found it in me to actually acknowledge her when she's around. Is this grudge justified or AITA?

1k5qq94,AITA for not reaching out?,"Hi Reddit, I (19F) have two close friends (also 19F) I've spent nearly every day with during our first year of university. Recently, they've started to distance themselves from hanging out. One (let’s call her Diana) joined a sorority and got busy, and the other (Alice) has been going through mental health struggles. I’m a major overthinker, so I tried not to stress. We all share a Life360 group, and I noticed they were hanging out at Diana’s dorm, something we rarely do. I’d been asking to hang out often, but kept getting a no. When I asked why I wasn’t invited, they didn’t respond and changed the topic. Then Alice turned off her Life360 location altogether two days later, which felt even more off.
I reached out asking if I had done something wrong. They both said no and reassured me everything was fine, Diana even said to reach out anytime I’m upset. That helped, even if I still felt weird about it.
A month or so ago, Diana mentioned maybe going to her hometown for an upcoming holiday, but said it wasn’t certain. No updates were given after that. Then this past weekend, I saw a Snapchat story of Diana and Alice in a car together. I checked Life360 and they were two and a half hours away. It hit me, they had gone to Diana’s hometown without telling me. I asked in our group chat what was going on. They said they assumed I went home since I didn’t reach out. But I’m from out-of-state, and flying home isn’t cheap. I would've left Wednesday if I were going home because i have no classes Thursday(something they both know). They left Thursday afternoon. I explained I thought it was just an idea not a plan and apologized for the miscommunication, but shared that I was hurt they didn’t check in.
Diana got defensive, saying she always planned to go home and just offered the idea to whoever was interested, Alice apparently accepted. I apologized again and emphasized that I wasn’t trying to blame, just explaining how it felt. I got no response.
The next day, I privately messaged Diana to check in and clarify that I wasn’t calling them bad friends, just trying to express how I felt. Still no reply.
A few days later I texted Alice about a clothing order we had placed tg and let her know I’d give her and Diana some space. She replied quickly and asked me to pack up her stuff she keeps in my dorm. I did.
Now, with two weeks left in the semester, I don’t see this getting fixed. Thinking back, they’ve both been rude or given me attitude but brushed it off as “jokes” yet if I ever joked the same way, I was told to “shut the fuck up.” I think I’m done with the friendship. It hurts because we were so close all year. I still keep wondering, am I the asshole for not reaching out?",AmItheAsshole,Time_Side6426,2,0.75,6,2025-04-23 04:37:25+00:00,Not the A-hole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k5qq94/aita_for_not_reaching_out/,True,Not the A-hole

Maybe I wouldn’t be so disgusted if I didn’t already feel like he prioritized his older son over our 16mth old. Which he denies, of course, but to me there’s no denying it now. I can’t shake the disgusted look on my face. It’s been over an hour now. I said it was a “weird choice”, he became defensive & said i was negative. 
I had to get out of bed and go sleep in another room because I am so grossed out that he treats our son like he’s barely his own child.

I simply said there was one hanging out the window a couple weeks ago saying shit to my daughter and her friend and it really pissed me off. He went off the rails, yelling at me that my daughters stuck up and his gfs kids were just trying to talk them, blah blah blah.

1k5ps22,AITAH by telling my mom no more babysitting at our house after she did not respect our boundaries?,"I had a problem with my mom and brothers. My mom and my husband and me live in the same home. Me and my husband work and pay the bills and my mom is retired but got some money from the babysitting as spending money. My mom was babysitting my 2 neices and 1 nephew from 2 different brothers of mine. Brother 1’s kids (2 and 3yo) were not very disciplined kids and were rowdy and my brother would not pick them up in a timely manner or even let us know if he would be late. Initially we were ok with it but my husband started having mental health issues because he was coming home and my mom was stressed, the home was loud and he couldn’t relax. The kids wouldn’t leave until 7pm most days which didn’t allow us to get our home put together each night or feel like we could unwind after work. 

My brother 2 had only his daughter who was 14-17 months old at the time but she was quiet and listened most of the time and would be picked up by 4pm. me and my husband would get home around 5:30-6pm. Brother 2 was understanding of the issues and knew to be responsible with his daughter. 

After repeatedly asking my mom to build a boundary with brother 1 and her not doing it, my husband and I began having issues between us and my mom. We went through months of discussing and finding ways to accommodate like having them come at a certain time every day to pick up their kids like brother 2 did. However my mom would say she would do it and not follow through. The situation kept getting worse with my husband asking for a better solution as our stress levels and lack of relaxation was really getting to him. 

We had so many discussions with my mom and his fan together where she would say she would do as we asked but didn’t follow through. My mom said we didn’t like brother 1 and that’s why we were asking for the boundary. After several arguments we told my mom we didn’t want to have brother 1’s kids being babysat here she said ok but then they showed up a couple weeks later after she reassured me they weren’t coming anymore. This led to a huge argument between my husband and I. He was so fed up and told me no more babysitting for anyone. I told my brother 2 about this and he got upset and his wife did too. My mom went to his house after the argument and we’re not sure what she said but I did have a conversation about the situation with him the next days and it seemed he understood. Within a week  they told me I couldn’t spend time with any of their 3 kids and cut me off. 

Brother 1 has always been irresponsible and doesn’t think about consequences. Brother 2 is very responsible and knows boundaries without being told. They are about 2yrs apart and I’m 7 and 9 years younger than them.

1k5pit1,AITAH for this? I genuinely have to explain!,"Me and my family have moved out of the US and have been gone for just about a year here in June. Although I love my wife, my MIL can be pretty estranged. Let me explain:

Before moving out of the US we legit lived 20 minutes up the road from her and she never wanted to really hang out or do much but complained that we didn’t see her often or invite her to things… everytime I offered to get drinks or some food with me she turned me down without hesitation…

Fast forward to last year she insisted that she 
should come visit us for the Christmas Break. We of course said yes! We thought it would be a grand ole time.

To summarise I’m just going to give a brief conclusion of her time here for that break:

-Stated she would pay for half of the Air BnB (she helped pick it and everything). Only gave us about $100 for a $1000 Air BnB. 
We never asked for our share.

-She literally complained about every single thing. We were a 5 minute walk from the beach. All you had to do was walk through a beautiful palm tree field and boom a beautiful beach. She never went alone and complained when we went as a family. We even went to some pretty good restaurants and still complaints. But she kept saying she was happy.

I could truly go on for days about how she acted during this trip that just didn’t align with her words at all. My wife even pulled her aside and asked if she was okay a couple of times because she noticed.
—
Fast forward to today. She is insisting that she has to come back to visit us. No problem. We said yes. But the issue at hand here is that she is complaining that we won’t allow her to fly in on the 15th when we aren’t off of work/school until the 20th. And it would be a lot easier for her to just fly directly to the place that we will be  staying at for our Christmas vacation rather than flying in on the 15th and having to road trip with us and having to squeeze in a tiny car…

AITAH for telling her no? We simply don’t want to spend those extra days with her because she spends most of her time alive just complaining and being negative all the time. We are just trying to be polite and blame it on our limited space.

(Too elaborate on the space. She over packs for things. My wife does as well. If you know anything about cars we drive a Mazda 2. I am 200cm tall.)

1k5olwo,AITA for not involving myself with my MIL when she complains about not having a relationship with us?,"My boyfriend and I have two young kids. His relationship with his mom (my MIL) has always been rocky. She and his dad divorced when he was in middle school, and after that things got worse between them. She struggled with a drinking and lying problem for years, and when they did speak, she’d never really focus on him—it was always gossip about others, never meaningful conversation or connection. That kind of negativity pushed him away even more.

Now as adults and parents, she still hasn’t really shown much interest or effort with our little family. She barely has a relationship with our children. We’ve asked her multiple times to babysit or spend time with the kids, and she always has an excuse as to why she can’t—yet she’s very present and involved with her other son’s kids. She watches them, posts about them, and spends time with them regularly. But with ours? She’s barely around. My 2-year-old didn’t even recognize her and hid behind my boyfriend’s legs when she came over once.

At the same time, she constantly complains to me about not having a relationship with our kids or with my boyfriend. She’s messaged me multiple times venting that she’s “so over” him, upset that he doesn’t show up to family events, doesn’t talk to her, or doesn’t reply to her messages.

My wife was not impressed with this at all. She said that we need to be ""on the same page as preschool"" because they don't cuddle everybody that cries there.

1k656iz,AITA for not crying about my 15yo nephew going to juvie?,"My mom sent me(26F) a screenshot this morning of texts between her and my sister (36yo). We live down south now, they’re up on the east coast. We found out yesterday my sis had to pick my nephew (15yo) up from the police station for getting caught at a party with a gun (his fingerprints are on it and he has pictures on his phone with it), he was put on probation. All he cared about was getting his phone back from the cops. Today’s update is that the police took him to juvie (not sure why yet).

In Nov 2023 my nephews dad passed away and although him and my sister were not together, they were still best friends since their teens, & it’s been hard on everyone. He’s been smoking bud (with my sisters permission, no one else approves), skipping school, will turn his location off and not answer the phone, and constantly tries to scam everyone out of money by threatening to be on the streets to get it instead. He also posts pictures on social media with gang-related poses.

My dad and my brother should be there for him, they aren’t the best examples of men but they’re stayed out of jail. There aren’t really any other men who are positive examples for him to follow either like a mentor. Being long distance there’s only so much my mom and I can do but talk to him about his choices and where they’re leading him. I feel I’ve done everything I can to support them without putting myself out, including financially. 

My initial reply: That’s the consequences of his actions *nephew & sis* are gonna learn one way or another 

Mom: No it’s *SIS* fault 
She’s the parent and her job is to guide him and protect him and she did not. She let him loose on the streets to do whatever. SMH. must be nice not to be affected by it though

1k61o5j,WIBTA if I applied for a job I learned about through my friend if I was going to learn about it anyway?,"My coworker and I are pretty close. I would consider her a friend. We both:

* work at our university
* are majoring in English (although, she is double majoring in psychology too)
* are looking for stuff to put on our resume, which we've discussed before
* use the same site for job-hunting, because it's offered through our school

During a shift, she told me about a job under our school's English department she was interested in, because it would look really good on a resume. I also really want to apply for this job (since it would look good for the industry I want to pursue and networking is extremely important), but I learned about it through her. **Under any other circumstance, I would straight-up just not apply, because that's low as hell.**

The thing is, I know for a fact I would have *eventually* found this job posting on my own since I have been checking for new job/internship opportunities every few days for the past couple of weeks *on the same site*. But again, I technically did learn about it through her, so I feel like it comes across as me trying to steal an opportunity from her. And I guess I kind of would be.

She's a very chill person, but I haven't known her super long and cannot say with certainty that this wouldn't hurt her feelings (assuming I did get the position). However, she already has a lot more experience on her resume than I do, and her ""main"" major is psychology anyway. That's the field she wants to work in.

I really feel at a loss. In this job market, you gotta do what you gotta do to thrive, but I don't want to have bad blood with her or put a hole in our relationship as coworkers and as friends.

In our early 20’s, this friend (we’ll call her L) decided that they wanted to move over seas for a year to experience working in a new country. I was sad, but tried to be supportive as I knew this was what they wanted. 

About 12 months in she met her future husband, we’ll call him D. They moved to another country together and settled down with what seemed to be some sense of stability. I’d been missing her and so asked if she was up for a visit. She said yes, we discussed dates and I booked my flights. 

When I arrived though, it became apparent that her then boyfriend (future husband) D had no interest in spending any time getting to know me.

Fast forwards a couple of years and L reaches out to tell me that they’re both moving back to our home country. I’m excited, happy to have her home and hopeful that D and I can try to build a friendship.

They threw a welcome home party for themselves which actually turned out to be an engagement party. Talking to L’s family who I had been quite close to, I found out D had asked for her entire family’s permission to marry her and as a joke, I made a comment along the lines of “hey, nobody asked me for my permission!” to D.

Everyone had laughed, I’d meant it as a joke and thought it had been taken that way. 

It was apparent that something was wrong though afterwards as every time I invited L and D to an event or party, they would make excuses not to come or only L would come. I finally asked about this and L told me I’d made D uncomfortable with my comment at the engagement party and that he didn’t want to hang out with me. I felt bad and reached out to apologise and clear the air. 

At the time, he accepted my apology but still never came to anything I invited them to. However, for L’s sake I continued to put effort in to trying to build a friendship. 

Cue my 30th birthday where they were both invited. L turned up with her family but D did not come. About an hour into being there L told me they had to leave soon as they had another event to get to and I was admittedly hurt by this, because this birthday was a big deal to me and they had known that.

Now admittedly, I had been drinking *a lot* so I don’t actually remember making the comment I did, but later, after L stopped talking to me and I reached out to find out why, they told me I’d made a comment about D and they didn’t appreciated it, so they’re cut off contact with me with no explanation.  

The comment in question was essentially “I don’t understand what you see in him, but if he makes you happy I’ll support you”. 

I apologised for upsetting them and didn’t deny that I’d probably made that comment because honestly, that’s how I’d felt about him for a while as I had been hurt that it felt like I was the only one putting any effort into both “friendships” for years and that I had gone out of my way to try and be welcoming and supportive only to be rebuffed at every turn.

So, AITA? ",AmItheAsshole,marshmallowmrow,4,0.67,25,2025-04-23 07:35:34+00:00,No A-holes here,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k5tdhj/aita_for_expressing_my_opinion_about_a_friends/,True,No A-holes here
1k5oajh,AITA for telling my girlfriend's family that I don't want to give rides?,"I (24M) recently got my driver's license, so at the moment I'm choosing a car to drive. Here where I live, a car is usually quite expensive and it's not something that people change so often (because it's difficult to have the money to change) - so at the moment I'm choosing a car that suits my needs:

* I live with my parents (temporarily), and they have their own car;
* I go to work in person twice a week, the other days I work from home;
* I usually go out with my girlfriend (25F) at weekends;
* I go to the gym (which is about 400m from home);

So, I found a car that suits me well: the Fiat 500. It's a car that's cheap to maintain and consumes very little.

Well, that said, there was a lunch at my girlfriend's house recently and there was me, her and most of her close family. While we were talking, I mentioned that I'd finally gotten my license and that I was looking to buy a car. Her grandmother asked me which car I had in mind, and I said I was thinking of the Fiat 500 and jokingly pointed out:

""That car would suit me because I don't like giving rides""

As it turned out, the atmosphere at the table became tense, and we soon changed the subject.

The next day, my girlfriend calls me and says that after I left, her siblings and her brother's girlfriend told her that they were very upset by my comment, saying “Gee, we're always willing to give rides” and that I was selfish. My girlfriend and I have been together for 6 years - and if I've almost never asked for a ride. 

When my girlfriend tells me this, she says “You need to understand that my family doesn't understand you the way your family and I understand you” - as if I have some kind of “problem” because I simply don't want to give them a damn ride in my damn car that I haven't even bought yet. 

I take a stand and say to her, ""I didn't say that if I have to, I'll refuse - it doesn't even make sense for the three of them to be hurt by a situation that didn't even happen. They all have cars, they all know how to drive and they would hardly NEED a ride from me.""

In a way, she wanted me to apologize for the comment and sort of say, ""I was joking!"" and laughed it off

But I don't see why I'm wrong in this.

AITA for telling my brother and sister-in-law that I don't want to give other people a ride in a damn, comically small Fiat 500?

TL;DR - I recently got my license and I'm going to buy a tiny car because I don't like hitchhiking. I said that I don't like hitchhiking with my girlfriend's family and now they're upset with me.",AmItheAsshole,r4g3_qu1t3r,146,0.9,67,2025-04-23 02:22:41+00:00,No A-holes here,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k5oajh/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriends_family_that_i/,True,No A-holes here
1k556pp,AITA for wanting my parents to turn down the TV?,"Myself (23F) and my boyfriend (25M) have recently moved back in with my parents after living out of home for the past two years. We’re both studying, and with rent in our area completely out of control, my parents kindly agreed to let my boyfriend move in as well so we could save for a house deposit. Due to personal reasons, moving in with his own parents wasn’t an option.

We’re really grateful but one issue has been plaguing us since we moved in - the TV volume.

My bedroom is down a short hallway from the living room. My parents’ nightly routine has always been to watch TV from about 4pm until midnight, sometimes even 1am. At least once a week, one or both of them will fall asleep on the couch and leave the TV blaring all night.

This wasn’t a huge issue when I was younger, as the volume was more reasonable. But as they’ve gotten older and more deaf (both in their 60s), the volume has steadily increased to almost unbearable levels. It’s made studying difficult and sleeping even worse. I’ve sort of gotten used to it, but my boyfriend is a really light sleeper and he’s found it nearly impossible to get a full night’s sleep. He’s exhausted, struggling to concentrate on his studies, and becoming a grumpier version of himself. I honestly can’t blame him though. It’s the sleep deprivation. 

I usually text my parents around 11pm asking if they could turn the TV down. My mum is fine with it, but my dad gets annoyed, says he can’t hear anything, and convinces her to turn it back up. I’ve also had private chats with mum, explaining that both of us have uni or work early in the morning. She promises to keep it down but doesn’t. Because of my dad. 

What frustrates me the most is they HAVE a TV in their upstairs bedroom. It’s newer, bigger, and already set up with all their streaming apps. I’ve asked my mum if past a certain time could they use that one instead, especially since they always complain about bad backs from sleeping on the couch. But their attitude is “This is our house and we’ll watch TV where we want.”

I get it. It is their house. But AITA for wishing they’d just turn it down a bit past 10 or 11pm? Or use the bedroom TV sometimes? I don’t want to seem ungrateful, especially with how much we’re saving by being here. But it’s starting to take a huge toll on both of us. And I feel guilty for putting my boyfriend through this while he is going through an extremely busy time in uni.

1k4xy21,AITA for telling my sister that my boyfriend went to school with her favorite actress?,"I(20f) was looking through some of my boyfriend(21)’s school photos and saw one with him standing next to a girl who looks shockingly like an actress(22f) who’s quite famous in our country. Played a lead role in two very successful series. I asked him if the girl in the photo is who I think she is and he nodded.

A few days later I mentioned it during dinner. My sister(13) has been begging my boyfriend to dm her and ask for a signed photo or calendar. My boyfriend always said no gently, saying he doesn’t think it would be appropriate. They were classmates but not close friends and he hasn’t spoken a word to her since their last class together back in 2021.

1k4nvtz,AITA if I would to gauge my ears knowing that my bf doesn't want me to?,"I (f) and my bf (m) have been together for almost 3 years now and I have been wanting to gauge my ears for about a year now. I've waited for a couple of reasons, number one I'm scared, number two I wanna be sure that this is what I want, and number three when ever I mention it to my bf he tells me how ugly he things gauged ears look and he wouldn't like it 

Don't get me wrong my bf is the sweetest person I've ever met and he always supports my decision except for this. I understand everyone has preferences but I'm just going through experimenting right now

I've always been open to him how I want to get piercings and tattoos cause this has something I've always wanted even since I was a kid. But I remember when it was more towards the beginning of our relationship and I told him how I wanted to basically be covered in tattoos (just like my body that I can cover) he seemed against it. But now that we've been dating for a while he seems to understand it a little bit better because I've explained it to him more but I've been mentioning the gauge earrings for about a year now ever since I kind of decided that I really really wanted them it's always something I thought about. but ever since I decided I actually wanted them I started mentioning it. He, like before, is very against it but I realize how long it takes to do it and I just don't want to have to wait for him to be on track just for me to do what I want with my body. But I also don't want him to resent me for doing it.

So AITA if I gauge my ears knowing that my boyfriend doesn't want me to?
 
Edit: I just wanted to give a little context. For 1 If I were to gauge them I wouldn't go any bigger then a quarter if even that. 2 he wouldn't break up with me because of them he's made that very clear, we aren't that type of couple to leave over little things, but he just don't like how they look. 3 he said I can do them if it's something I want it's just he doesn't like how they look. 4 I understand I can't convince him too like them my thing is that when I told him in the beginning of our relationship how I wanted tattoos and he didn't like it eventually he ended changing his mind, not because of me but because he ended liking how they look (we all change what we like and he is very open minded).  I just don't want him to decide in a year or 2 that he does like them and then all the time I could've spent working on gauging them is lost. On the other hand I don't wanna get them and then he doesn't end up liking how they look. I don't wanna change him or his opinion but I also know that I haven't changed mine and what I want and this is something I've wanted on for years.

Edit 2: just a little bit more context. I'm not worried about sex I doubt he will not wanna have sex with me even if I do it. Also I have long curly hair that covers my ears most of the time so he won't even see them most of the time unless I have my hair up.   Also I don't have any tattoos currently I do have four piercings in each ears and a nose piercing even though I do plan on getting more piercings. The reason I know he won't break up with me for something like this is because we aren't together for our looks he loves me for my personality and that's the same way I feel for him. When we met I was very traditional looking and I've done a lot of stuff to look different mostly based on my hair the reason I want to do this is because I don't want to look generic and simple.

1k49e6j,AITA For Wanting More Effort From my Platonic Best Friend While I'm In Hospital?,"I, (19f) have two chronic illnesses, I've had one since birth and I was very recently diagnosed with crohns. I've always experienced side effects that come with being chronically ill, but since I had grown up with this chronic illness, I never felt that negative about it as it was normal to me. When I developed crohns last year this all changed, my physical abilities plummeted, whereas before I was somewhat ablebodied, now I am pretty much fully disabled. I am constantly in so much pain, I can't hold a job, even working one day a week, I'm a regular in the hospital, most doctors recognise me at this point and it's taken a huge mental toll. I feel helpless, especially due to the fact that the medication that helps me function have horrible side effects. It's like I can't just be healthy, I have to pick what type of illness I'd prefer and I'm really struggling to wrack my head around the fact that that the older I'm getting, the more disabled I'm getting, not the other way around. 

Now onto my best friend of 5 years (22M). I've never been the type to need a lot of emotional support health wise due to the fact it used to be normal, in fact I have always been the therapist friend, but because my whole world is turning upside down I feel like I need a lot of support right now.
When I was in hospital last month, I was at a real low point, I was in hospital for quite a while and I recieced three ""how are you"" texts the whole time I was there, and not one single offer of a hospital visit from my best friend. Even though I was hurt from the lack of care he'd shown about me I let it slide, and had a short, calm conversation once I was out of hospital about how this made me feel. Instead of an apology, he managed to make it about him, and he kept saying things like ""I WAS thinking of you"" and ""I WANTED to visit"". But actions speak a lot louder than words, and guess who had to then spend twenty minutes comforting him instead of the other way around? All I wanted was ""I'm sorry I made you feel that way, I'll try and do better"" but he never even acknowledged my feelings at all. 

Now things have technically changed. Whenever I rant to him about how powerless I feel, I end up getting the same, short text back saying things along the line of ""that isn't fair to you, you're so strong"". Which is technically the right thing to say, but his actions don't say the same. I am now in hospital again, less than a month later than the last trip and even though the texts have been far and few between he did offer to visit me this time! I was so excited to see him, as this hospital stay has been the worst yet, but then the day of the visit and I receive a text saying that ""something has come up, I can't see you anymore"" and he didn't even try to reschedule. What was this thing that had come up? A sleepover that he wasn't shy about posting about on his Instagram story. Am I the ahole for wanting more emotional support, or am I just expecting too much from a platonic friendship?

1k3zmn7,AITA for aggressively shooing away a stranger for walking toward my car while I cried in a supermarket parking lot?,"Quick background: My dad passed away 2 months ago after a battle with pancreatic cancer. So crying randomly is kind of a thing lately.

I had just finished shopping when a wave of sadness hit, so I ran to the car for a quick cry before heading home. 

Across the parking lot I could see a man in the drivers seat of a minivan staring at me. All of a sudden the back door of the van slides open and a woman steps out and makes her way towards me- full eye contact and heading right for my door.

It wasn’t clear by her body language what her intentions were but I wasn’t really interested in finding out so I did my best to put on a scary face and shooed her aggressively. 

She did turn and walk away but her expression read something like - “ok asshole” and now that I’m calm I’m second guessing my immediate reaction.

I know it’s probably best to air on the side of caution but she might think twice about helping next time she sees someone in distress, and that time they might really need the help.

1k3l7cr,AITA for refusing to accept money for tutoring?,"My(21m) best friend ‘May’(20f) has a little sister(16). Their parents asked me to tutor her and help her prepare for her IELTs exam after May told them I did well in mine.

The thing is, I took mine three years ago. Had to take an English proficiency test in order to get into law school. It was at the end of eight years at a British international school, where I had to speak, read and write in English everyday. All the teachers are from the UK and more than a few of my friends were foreigners. I have since spent much less time using English and have come to rely much more on our native language for both my education and social life.

So I am not as good as I was and would probably not be able to get an overall band score of 8 again. Not to mention I’ve had no experience tutoring someone. That’s why I told their parents I only want to do this as a favor and don’t want to be paid for it; I don’t feel I’m competent enough to be compensated.

They insisted on providing me with snacks though. Usually fruits I really like, like the kiwifruit. I said yes to this but declined money.

1k3hyta,AITA for assuming my breeder was trying to convince me to get a certain puppy?,"Link to DM conversation — https://imgur.com/a/JBb2x8h


So I've been in contact with a breeder out of state for a puppy. Things were going really well, and it was down to choosing between a male or female.

I let her know that it was a hard decision. That while the male reminded me a lot of my past dog - I had never owned a female before and was curious to see who she would grow to be. So we had decided on her instead.

The breeder then responded by letting me know their two personalities - that the female was more herding oriented, and likes to herd the cat. The male gets along well with the guardian family's children and loves toys more than the girl. 

She then sent me a video of the boy being super playful with the kids.

Because I had already told her that I have cats and being good around kids was important to me, I just thought she was trying to quietly push me towards the boy. 

I tried to respond how I did because I wanted her to know I wasn’t upset or mad. She runs a working farm and I would totally understand wanting to keep a puppy with a strong herding instinct. I also wanted to give myself an out to choosing another female from another litter by the same breeder when I said I would talk things over with family, in case I really wanted a girl.

But I realize now that she might have just not seen where I said I wanted the girl. She runs a working farm after all and might have just been tired — and maybe she also forgot I had a cat?

Now I’m super stressed out because I don’t know how to fix this.

I’m …. almost considering switching my breed choice to a different one altogether. I feel so ashamed.

1k38ho8,AITA for saying no to my girlfriend’s friend who wanted to use our kitchen?,"My girlfriend and I live together in our apartment. Recently, one of her friends—who I’m not particularly close with—asked if she could come over *just to use our kitchen*. She lives in a dorm but says the kitchen there is too dirty to cook in.

That already felt strange to me, because I barely know her, and it’s not like it’s an emergency. But what made it even weirder is that my girlfriend told me we should feel *honored* that her friend asked us instead of someone else. That rubbed me the wrong way—it felt kind of entitled, like we’re supposed to say yes out of flattery?

Also, this isn’t a situation where the friend is in trouble or starving—she has a meal plan and can eat at the dining halls. It’s not like she doesn’t have options. She just suddenly wanted to cook something and decided her dorm kitchen was too gross. My guess is she remembered our place being clean because we hosted her (and others) a few times for dinner.

But here's the thing: **this wasn’t a social request at all**. It wasn’t like, “Hey, want to cook together sometime?” or “Could we hang out and cook?” It was literally just “Can I use your kitchen to cook my own food.” That’s it. No invitation to connect or spend time together—just a one-way request to use our space.

Another important detail: I’m the one who uses the kitchen 99% of the time. I do almost all the cooking and the dishes, so it feels like *my personal space* in the house. It's not just a shared utility room to me—it's where I do something I actually enjoy and take care of both of us. So letting someone else use it, especially someone I don’t know well, isn’t something I’m automatically cool with.

For what it’s worth, I’m not against helping out her friends. Over the summer, one of her other friends—who I really like and would love to be closer to—stayed with us for a week because she didn’t have a place to stay temporarily. We both agreed to it, and of course she had full use of the kitchen and everything else. It felt mutual and respectful.

But this current situation doesn’t feel the same. It was just a request out of nowhere, with no real context or urgency, and it caught me off guard. Also, I’ve had a negative experience before with one of her other friends, who turned out not to be supportive of our relationship. So I know I might be a little guarded now.

When I reacted like, “WTF? That’s weird,” my girlfriend told me I was overreacting and being rude about her friend.

Is this kind of request normal and I’m just being too sensitive?

Edit: If it were just a one-time request, I honestly think I’d be okay with it. But she wanted to use our kitchen *for a whole week*, including sharing our refrigerator space — and we live in a pretty small one-bedroom, one-bath apartment. That’s what made it feel like a bigger ask than it initially sounded.

Edit: She literally asked us to share our kitchen for a whole week. She mentioned wanting to cook things like chicken breast and avocado toast, and it sounds like she’d want to make it every day. She also asked about using our fridge to store things.

**Edit:** Thank you everyone for your responses! Sorry I couldn’t reply to each one individually. I really appreciate all the perspectives — it helped me see the situation from different angles.

Even though I still feel it’s a bit much for someone to ask to use our kitchen for a whole week to cook toast and whatever she wants to cook without any important events, I’m considering giving her a chance and seeing how it goes. Also, my girlfriend mentioned that her friend doesn’t have her own pots or cooking tools, so I’d be sharing mine too — which adds to the ask a bit.

Like someone mentioned, I was mostly worried this might just be the beginning and that it could become a regular thing — but I guess we’ll cross that bridge when we get there.

1k31xg1,AITA for continuing to spend money on in-game skins even though my girlfriend strongly disagrees with it and thinks I’m being financially irresponsible?,"I (24M) recently showed my girlfriend (22F) my bank account, and she saw that I had spent $20 on a skin in Marvel Rivals. She doesn’t like the game because she feels it contributes to the sexualization of women, and she told me that by buying skins like that, I’m supporting a harmful system. She sees me as part of the problem for continuing to spend money on these types of games.

We’ve had this argument before, especially about Fortnite, where I’ve spent quite a bit on skins over time. Her frustration is that these are free-to-play games, yet I keep spending money on them. When I try to explain that I just liked the skin, she cuts me off and says, “You’ve said that about so many others that just rot on your account and never get used again.” Then she asks me, “What do you even gain from spending money on something in a game that’s already free? Does it make you better player? Does it give you an ability? Will it help you win more games?”

I understand that it’s not just about the $20. It’s about the fact that we’ve argued about this before, and from her perspective, nothing has changed. I can see how it feels like I’m just brushing off her concerns by doing it again.

She also thinks I’m being financially irresponsible. And yeah, my income isn’t perfectly steady right now, but I still try to manage things. I make over $500 a week, and I put $300 into savings every paycheck. I use the remaining $200 or so for essentials and sometimes small things I want, like this skin. I know living paycheck to paycheck isn’t ideal, but I try not to overspend or put myself in a bad spot financially. Still, even if I have money left after saving and bills, she doesn’t think that justifies spending on something like this.

I get where she’s coming from, and I don’t want to dismiss her values or how she feels. I just also don’t think I’m doing something horribly wrong by using a bit of my own money on something I enjoy. I’m not sure how to explain that to her without sounding selfish.

AITA for continuing to buy skins even though it upsets her and my finances aren’t perfect?

⸻

TL;DR: I bought a $20 skin in a free game and my girlfriend got upset because she thinks it promotes harmful portrayals and that I’m being financially irresponsible. We’ve argued about this before, and she says I never change. I do save most of my paycheck and spend the rest carefully. When I explain that I just liked the skin, she says I’ve said that about a bunch of others I never use and asks what I even gain from it. AITA?

⸻

EDIT: I see i’ve been missing a few key information in here. We’ve been together for two years, long distance, I live in Texas while she lives in Sweden. I live with my grandparents and pay 5 bills in total adding close to $300+ but I manage to pay them off when due. I agree on her terms of the Rivals game sexualizing women but I do not play it for that reason. I spend money on games when a skin I like the look of comes out, but I also have the will to not buy it and just wait for a later day for when it comes back. She also has her own needs and buys clothes and here recently pokemon cards but she makes sure she has money for it just like how I do. If I’m missing anything, I may have already commented on it below, Thank you all for your input as well.

1k2mjyl,AITA for refusing to help my mother in law?,"Hi, 32F and I have a problem with my MIL 58F. She thinks she is entitled to control everyone around her whenever she needs help and I'm sick of it. She is leaving tomorrow for a 7days long trip, she booked the flight on a Saturday knowing that someone would take her to the airport, without asking first if someone could take her. Then yesterday she calls my husband 33M and asks him to take her inside the airport and show her where to go and drop her luggage because quote ""you travel so much and you know what to do"". Now the airport is not far from her home (like 30 min by car) but if we stay longer than 10 minutes in the parking lot we might take a ticket and I don't want to pay for the long stay. AITA? I Always feel like my husband and I are too kind and get stuck doing things BC otherwise we feel guilty or ungrateful. This is just the last example of her behaviour, she always invites us to her house and then suddenly there's something to do (like moving forniture or going to the dumpster) NOTE she has two sons,but she never asks my BIL 27M for help and HE STILL LIVES WITH HER! My husband and I live live like 1 hour from her and my husband works 12h a day while my BIL works from home but when she needs something she calls my husband because quote ""BIL is always so tired"". And this thing has been going on for years and still no one tells he anything they just go with it. And when someone tells her no she makes them feel guilty... I've had enough. So..AITA here?

UPDATE 


We all got together(me,husband, BIL, MIL and ex-husband) for lunch and to celebrate Easter.(This was set 2 weeks ago, I forgot to mention it in the original post) She didn't ask who was taking her and when it was time to leave  her ex-husband and my BIL took her. I don't know if they got inside with her, I'm just glad we didn't take her but this is a wake up call for both my husband and I, we need to set boundaries and not be afraid to stand up for ourselves like the grown adults we are. I showed him all the comments and he agreed to stand up to her more.

1k2lymy,AITA for expressing my disgust at a dish from my girlfriend's culture?,"My (27M) girlfriend (24F) is Brazilian and since we got together she’s been introducing me to her country’s cuisine, and I’ve loved everything she's made and I've tried so far. But last night she took me to Brazilian steakhouse and at some point she asked the waiter for a dish that they didn’t serve here, but apparently is a staple in Brazilian barbecues; it was only later she explained to me that she was asking for chicken hearts. And because they didn’t have it she later told me she would try to find it in the Brazilian store she usually goes to and make it at home, but I told her not to bother and that I wasn't interested in trying it. 

She couldn’t understand why I wasn’t interested, so I told her that the whole idea of eating chicken hearts sounded a bit icky (that’s the word I remember saying, she later said I told her it was “disgusting”, so I can’t be sure, but the intention is the same anyway). And she got really upset and told me about how eating organs is not unusual in many cultures and that even if I didn’t want to try it, framing it as disgusting was disrespectful on my part. But I only said anything because she kept pushing for an explanation, so I don’t know what she expected me to do - to lie? ",AmItheAsshole,HilliamWurt,5044,0.88,1941,2025-04-19 02:21:10+00:00,No A-holes here,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k2lymy/aita_for_expressing_my_disgust_at_a_dish_from_my/,True,No A-holes here
1k2hdtd,AITA for TALKING to my BROTHER?,"I 19f am currently living with my parents during college break. I met my brother 23m at college and yes even though we have different parents he sees me as his little sister (one he lost after his mum had a premature baby) and I see him as almost a parental figure and the brother I never had. 

I live in college dorm and my brother lives at home because his home is nearby. While at dorm I talk to my brother regularly, basically everyday, telling him everything that happened that day. I tell all this to my mother too, and sometimes my father, as we're very close. No one at my college talks to their mum for an hour straight but I do.

Now that I'm home for the break, my parents object me talking to my brother. They say ""no siblings talk this much"" and ""you don't talk to us this much like you talk to him"" and stuff like that. They've set a limit to our call timings. Keep in mind my parents have very well met my brother on multiple occasions and he has been to my house twice too. 

I don't understand this behaviour shown by my parents. Are they jealous? Do they think we're ""pretending to be siblings"" or something disgusting like that? Is it wrong of me to consider someone else family and give him importance? I'm so lost here. I started not talking to my parents to maybe make them understand that I talk to them way too much but I don't think they see it. Now my mum is mad at me and saying ""you can't be in the wrong and angry at the same time"". 

They were my priority but they took it for granted (shutting me down on several occasions for ""talking too much"").

1k2b9on,WIBTAH if I told my BF to just go home after he spent the entire day of our weekend together sleeping?,"My (20f) bf (20m) came to visit me for the weekend. He isn't working and it's an extended weekend because of Easter.

We are partially long distance, since I study in the same city where he lives but go home for the weekends every week, and I live about 200km from the city where he lives. So we see each other monday-thursday and then I go home.

Today he arrived at about 2:15pm, talked to my parents and me for a bit and than at around 3:00pm he fell asleep. It's 8:00 pm rn and he is still asleep.

I've tried to wake him up but he just looked up at me and told me that he is getting up just to fall aleep right after. He does this ALL THE TIME when I am over at his house, but he's never done it to this extent when he was over at my place. For anyone wondering, he doesn't have any medical condition causing this. 

I literally haven't eaten all day because I feel embarrassed to tell my parents that I am eating alone because my boyfriend has been asleep since he fucking showed up. 

I am so angry at him. He always complains about us not spending enough time together and now when we can be together the entire weekend he does this? 

Don't get me wrong, if he was tired from the drive or whatever I wouldn't mind him taking a nap for an hour or two, but this is fucking ridiculous.

I have plans for the weekend and also a lot of work I need to finish and I've been seriously thinking about telling him to just go home, cause what's the point of him being here if he is just going to sleep the whole day? WIBTAH if I did that?

1k27178,AITA for not giving my housemate enough notice that I would be having someone over?,"I (21F) rent a 2 bdr apartment with my housemate (20F). We’ve lived together for 8 months. It’s been okay until recently.

The issue started when I made plans to meet my bf, who I’ve been dating for about 2 months. We’ve both been busy and finally had a chance to meet.

We first talked about meeting 5 days ago, but didn’t confirm it. When we finally decided to meet the next day, I messaged my housemate around 1 a.m. (I knew she’d be awake) and let her know I was having a friend over who’d be staying the night. I didn’t say it was my boyfriend. I also couldn’t give an exact arrival time.

She asked if it was “a girl or a boy,” and I said it was a boy.

She’s never met him, this would be his first time over.

She asked if I was serious, saying it was short notice. I said yes, and she replied “lol.”

Then she came to my room and asked why I told her so late. I said the plans were last minute.

She said since we live together, I can’t bring strangers over with such short notice. Please note: I’ve had guys over before, but this was the first time one would spend the night.

She brought up that when she had a friend over, she told me days in advance and made sure I was comfortable. She said my lack of communication upset her and that she wished I handled it better.

She also said she didn’t like how I gave short notice when others came over and mentioned she would go hang out with another friend every time, though I never asked her to leave.

I told her I understood I should’ve given her more notice, but he wouldn’t be interacting with her and would mostly stay in my room, only using the shared bathroom.

She said it’s not about who it is, it’s about how little she knows about the person, which makes her uncomfortable.

I told her I could cancel if she felt that uneasy, but she said she wasn’t asking me to do that,just to communicate sooner.

She added she’s not going to bend over backwards for my plans, but I hadn’t asked her to, since he wouldn’t be affecting her directly.

I started to think maybe I was being selfish and tried putting myself in her shoes—but realized I wouldn’t care if she brought someone over with short or no notice.

1k1xchn,AITA for cancelling plans on my boyfriend?,"I (21F) and my partner (27M) have been dating for around 3 months now. For context before we had even gotten into a relationship I had told my partner that these next few months / year I would be busy because I am a third year student about to do an internship this summer for my bachelor's program. He was aware that I would be busy and that school would be my priority, so if he was not okay with this he could opt out of not dating me.

So I recently got a paid internship out of the several unpaid options my class provides on a pre-approved list for my field work class. Since I'll be working as care giver I had to get a TB test, originally I was supposed to work tomorrow aka this Friday, but had to give away my shift so I could go back to the hospital to get my TB results read. My partner was originally supposed to hang out with friends this Friday, and had told me this last week that he was thinking of cancelling because he didn't want to drive to the city to hang out with his friends, before I had gotten the TB test scheduled / done I had proposed maybe I would switch my shift anyways so we could hang out. (Mind you I had never gotten a TB test before so I wasn't aware I had to go back in 72 hours to have the results read). Because I realized I not only had to go back to the hospital, but run to the store and get cat food, film a mock interview for my field work class, and prepare for a wedding that I'll be attending in a few weeks I told him that we shouldn't hang out and that maybe he shouldn't tag along to come get my results with me since my schedule is full. He said it was alright, however he was being very dry and giving one word responses which is very abnormal of him. I asked if he was mad at me, and he clarified he wasn't mad but was definitely annoyed. I reminded him that he had plans originally with friends this Friday, and cancelled them not because I asked him to hang out, but because he didn't feel like driving to the city. He keeps telling me it's alright and he isn't mad, but I can tell he is annoyed. I feel very guilty about it, I'm an ex people pleaser and I already hate asking people to cover my shifts / cancelling plans on people but I'm trying to be better at prioritizing myself and my needs. I'm also a little annoyed at him because even though he claims he wasn't ""throwing a fit"" he still was giving me one word responses and calling me even though he knew I was feeling sick and continuing to prod me about how I feel, especially because I had informed him I would be very busy prior to the relationship and that school is the priority, and even though he says he understands I can still tell he is disappointed whenever I have to cancel plans or tell him we can't hang out a certain day because I have school or class work or other responsibilities. 

edited to add: I am a very independent slightly more introverted person, I'm definitely the type of person that sees life as ""if you want things done the right way, do it yourself"" I don't need help kind of person. I don't really enjoy being babied or feeling like I have to baby other people, and I also thrive and enjoy being alone because I value having time to decompress. I would have invited him along if it was just small simple errands, but because I have to be at the hospital during a very certain time I can't afford to be late/ goof around. My boyfriend is an extroverted people person, and tends to get FOMO and makes himself sad when he cancels plans with friends or even me, even if it isn't anything exciting. He loves taking his time and going with the flow and isnt as time oriented as I am. He also is very much a hold the door open for my girlfriend, hold her bags, be very attentive boyfriend (which isn't bad but when im trying to actively do something important it can get in the way how attentive he is). He thrives on interactions with people, and doesn't like being left out, which I understand and I have dedicated a lot of time to him, but this is the reason why I left the decision to pursuing a relationship to him because I know my boundaries and what I'm like and try to make him a priority, but wouldn't want someone to feel neglected in a relationship with me. I also have had a conversation with him about how I'm not used to dedicating so much time to a person because all of my friends are introverted/ we hang out only on our breaks so every few months, and my last relationship was a LDR, so he was aware of what he was getting into before dating me, I was very transparent with the kind of person I am and what my schedule would look like.

1k1wvo8,WIBTA if I clipped a hangnail anywhere (indoors) that's not my house?,"I want to preface that I'm not trying to win an argument, I just want to know genuinely what people think. Not trying to be proven right or wrong. Rip into me, I want to know so I can change my behaviors if need be.

TLDR of the situation:  
Took the lady I work for to court for a hearing for a family member of hers. Could not bring in many things in my purse, did not know this because was not educated about government building regulations, items had to be returned to car including a nail clipper.

My (27f) bf (31nb) asked why I even carry nail clippers on me in the first place. I told him, to clip my hangnails of course! He said that it's *disgusting* that I would clip hangnails/dead skin in public buildings. They really emphasized that it's super gross to clip nails/skin anywhere but your own house. (Not that I clip my whole nail! That *would* be gross!)

I'm not exaggerating when I say I get hangnails every single day. I moisturize (Aveeno)! But my efforts are futile. I always carry a small nail clipper with me to clip them so I don't rip them off and cause my fingers to bleed. It's a self care thing. I used to pick and make my fingers bleed all the time. Carrying clippers helps to carefully remove peeling skin or jagged nail edges. (No, I don't bite my nails; never have. The sensation is AWFUL.)

Is it really bad that I will, in public indoor places, occasionally clip a tiny hangnail off? Is it honestly disgusting? I figure it's no worse than shedding a hair or two, or having tiny flakes of skin fall off of you at all times which is why there's dust everywhere. Dust is mostly human skin. So if I add a tiny piece of hangnail to somewhere, is it disgusting?

Also, I have mild Trichotillomania/Dermatillomania that gets worse with stress/boredom. Having a clipper on me literally, as mentioned before, prevents me from getting booboos.

One last thing, is that I'm a germophobe and have moderate contamination OCD. I don’t touch a lot of things, wash my hands constantly, always have hand sanitizer on me when I go out, use it a lot, and wash my hands at any given opportunity. (Part of why my hands are so dry is from constant hand washing.) I also wipe down things I touch a lot, like my phone, several times a week.

**WIBTA if I clipped my hangnails/dead skin at indoor public spaces (or someone else's house)?** (Again, this is for my own knowledge and benefit, I'm not trying to be proven right and shove it in my bf's face, quite the opposite. I want to know if he's right and I'm being gross.)

1k1wpqi,AITA for having different wants in a friendship?,"For some context, both me and someone who i will name ""A"" are recovering from a fallout in our friendship, we both suffer from severe BPD (borderline personality disorder) and we are eachothers FPS (favorite people/person), the fallout in question happened when A experienced an episode so bad that it resulted in everybody in their friend group leaving them, including me, I spent 2 hours trying to calm them down even though I wasn't in a good mental state myself, having been recovering from an extremely unhealthy breakup that was still very recent at the time, me and A spent around a week apart after this, and then I eventually went back to them after some convincing from a friend.

Me and A have been struggling alot ever since we got back, talking to eachother like we're afraid of saying the wrong thing, i didn't want to get too close to them again because I was afraid of developing feelings for them (which has happened before), meanwhile, they were afraid of telling me all of their true emotions because everytime they have spoken about their feelings, its ended in abandonment.

Yesterday, we had a conversation about how we both felt, and we found that we felt very similarly, but wanted different things— i wanted space, I wanted time for myself, to develop a schedule and a life outside of A because I've been falling apart due to not having anything else to do, meanwhile, they wanted to spend more time with me, because they become unstable whenever they're alone, they suffer from extreme loneliness and paranoia whenever I'm not around.

To describe our points of view better: im still recovering from a breakup that was extremely detrimental to my mental health, the turmoil of said breakup resulted in me finding difficulty telling the difference between platonic and romantic relationships, it caused me to develop an avoidant attachment style, caused me to become terrified of spending too much time with A in fear of developing feelings for them. (We used to spend the entire day together, now, we spend 10 hours together per their insistence, even though I want it to be less.)

A, on the other hand, is struggling with many things in their homelife, things that prevent them from developing a proper social life, that i will not disclose either, they suffer from impulsivity and many addictions, they're coping with the loss of their entire friend group (they lost said friend group due to the episode, I was the only one who came back) and im basically the only one they talk to on a daily basis.

My mental state is very fragile at this moment in time, and A is well aware of that, which is why they've been hiding their true feelings from me, telling me that they're fine when they really aren't— they've been helping me cope with my feelings, but I've been struggling to help them cope with theirs because of how fragile I am mentally (though I still try,) I just feel so frustrated, I feel so selfish for how I've been dealing with all of this, and I just want to know if I truely am being selfish.",AmItheAsshole,throwaway_287373,3,0.81,7,2025-04-18 04:45:31+00:00,No A-holes here,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k1wpqi/aita_for_having_different_wants_in_a_friendship/,True,No A-holes here
1k1v4gs,AITA for saying my wife’s feng shui nonsense is nonsense?,"My (29M) wife (27F) believes in feng shui. I've had to deal with some frankly annoying nonsense like no mirrors in the bedroom, plants in specific spots, etc. for years - I don't normally care too much but I don't believe in it. 

On Tuesday we wanted to change one of our ceiling lights. I took the old one down but we didn't like the new one. We returned it and got a different one, but we're going on vacation tomorrow and I was going to do it after we get back. 

The old light wasn't put back up, so the wires in the conduit are capped and spread apart. It's by our entryway and so there's essentially a hole in our ceiling. 

She claims this is bad feng shui and is the cause for all of her misfortune this week. For example:

1. She's had ""the worst yeast infection of [her] life"" (direct quote from her, and admittedly it seems really bad from what she's described)
2. There was a fraudulent charge on her Amex today
3. She has had some prospects at work ghost her this week
4. She was told by Amex her signup offer wasn't legit and she's SOL (CFPB complaint incoming)

Probably other things she's mentioned, but these are her main ones. 

My argument was that prior to taking off the light I had a legitimately shit day on Monday... I got amazing news this morning however that had to do with that shit day (can't get into it). 

So, AITA for saying her belief is nonsense and refusing to put up the old light before we go?

We can't put the new light up yet because the base is smaller than the old one and we have to paint that part of the ceiling first. 

Edit: I'm putting the old light back up tomorrow before we go, it'll make her happy and that's what matters.

1k16im7,AITA for not appreciating my sister for doing my laundry?,"I (26F) have shared a room with my sister (32F) since January (about 4 months). We live in a 2 bedroom apartment and have a roommate who lives in the second bedroom and plans to move in with her fiancé in 2 months, as the lease ends. 

For context, my sister and I split time between this apartment and our family home to spend time with our parents, which is about an hour away. She has lived in this apartment without me for about 3 years and I joined to help lower the cost of rent and provide company as her roommate makes plans to leave the space. They both work harder and longer hours than I do and as a result make more money and have less free time. My sister is also notably very selfless and overworked because of the nature of her job, and thus will get distracted by work calls or tasks that she needs to complete in the moment. 

Today, I left the apartment in the morning to go to work as usual and left my pajamas on my bed to return to that night (I usually come to the apartment on Monday night and stay until Thursday night and use the same pajamas for the week). My sister worked from home and decided to do her own laundry. She decided to grab my pajamas from my bed and throw them in with her laundry before I got home. She then left the apartment to go to dinner and hang out at her boyfriend’s apartment. I was at a baseball game and then came home around 11PM. 

By the time I got home I began to wash up and try to go to bed. That’s when I realized that my pajamas were missing and thought maybe she had thrown them into the washer. I checked and learned that she had put them into the washer but had not finished the job by drying the clothes. Normally I would have other pajama shorts to wear to bed but this week I forgot to bring more and am relying on this one pair for the 3 nights here. 

I am now waiting for 2 hours for the dryer to finish (it’s not the strongest or best dryer in the world) and am feeling quite frustrated about the half job that she’s done. I know I should be appreciative that she cares to take care of me and my “dirty” laundry, but I feel frustrated that she did this without me asking and didn’t care enough to finish the job, ultimately inconveniencing me to the point of having to wait for the laundry to be done before I can go to bed.

She’s still at her boyfriend’s apartment, probably working late hours and spending time with him (the relationship is very new).

1k13095,AITA for being a liar as a child?,"I (16F) have got 3 friends (all 16F) who have been with me since grade 1. They're my closest friends, the ones I trust the most, share everything with, (I wish I could say 'and vice versa' here) they're my best friends basically. 

We're all into different colleges, chasing different goals but still we are in contact. We talk and hang out sometimes. One day, we were bored and had decided to meet at one of our friends house, play UNO, have some ramen, and chill yk. So we did and when we were having a convo, one of em randomly asked if we have ever lied to each other. All three of them said maybe once or twice but not more than that. I honestly told them that when we were younger, I loved making up stories and telling em. Mostly it'd be 'paranormal experiences' and stuff. I did it to look cool man, I admitted that I was a liar as a child. They said that they believed everything I said, and that my stories were really believable. 

Then suddenly their tone changed and they asked ""do you still lie though?"" I said ""nope, Ofcourse no one would believe my weird stories now."" To which one of them said ""sometimes you still do tell us weird stories, how do we know they're real and you're not lying?"" I replied ""Well, then you gotta trust me, I'm telling you the truth, I don't lie anymore"". I added ""tbh, sometimes when I'm feeling lazy to do something, I do lie about having some work or not feeling well, being busy just so that I won't have to go out"" 

Two of my friends thought that's alright, but one of them, let's call her Emily, who is the closest to me, kind of started to be a little distant from me. She doesn't talk to me the way she did before and when asked, why? She said ""I don't think I can trust you anymore, All this time I trusted you, but you're such a liar."" I was like whaaaaaaat? First thought she's kidding but when realised she's not, I asked her why she thinks that. Emily said ""I hate liars, didn't expect you to be one. You've been lying about alot of things all your life, and we innocent people believed you"" I. Was so confused. I'm 99.9% sure that all I've ever lied was when I was a child, and the stories I made up back then, and probably faking about having work and being sick to avoid going out cuz I'm a LAZY BUM! She disagreed and said ""there have been many instances where you have lied, and it's very recent."" This confused me so much, I don't think I've lied. But she wouldn't tell me what it was and told me not to bother her. This really shattered me from inside, I feel there's some misunderstanding. I dont want our friendship to end because of it but she won't communicate!

1k124n4,AITA if I don't want my sister's partner at my birthday celebration?,"My (26F) sister (24) has been with her partner (34M) for around 5 years, and they have a soon-to-be 4yo together.

 I invited my sister to celebrate my birthday, and she asked if he could also come. I only feel like TA because my boyfriend was welcome to celebrate her birthday with us (even though he didn't come.)

The problem is, dude drives me up the wall. He's very immature for his age, like he got stuck at 16. He isn't the brightest, and likes to try to butt into conversations and talk like he understands the subject when he obviously has no clue. He's a ""sovereign citizen,"" really into conspiracy theories, and likes to wear a belt with a hunting knife on it everywhere he goes. He isn't rude, per se, he just doesn't know how to socialize appropriately for his age, and sometimes it feels like my sister is babysitting him. She literally has to tell him what to do or not to do half the time.

I didn't want to invite him when I hosted Christmas this last year, but felt like I had to because it wouldn't be fair to my niece to not have both of her parents around. 

So, AITA??

1k0mezv,WIBTA if I told my dad to break up with his gf because she is bullying him?,"
My step mom has been in my life for over 10 years (im 19). She at one point lived in the house me and my dad used to live in (we moved so I don't see her much anymore) and while living together she took the strict rules from her household to ours, making me change my habits completely.  
Part of this I was fine with, and I respect her for now, she really helped getting us to behave better but at certain points it seemed too much.  
For example if I didn't clean up she would put everything I had on the floor into the trash, even if it had just fallen down, not caring what the items meant to me. 
Not only did she yell at me but also at my dad for not ""teaching me correctly"" even if it came to things such as me forgetting to say ""thank you"" after eating or moving my chair in after standing up. she's also reminds me off these things as well as small mistakes I made that she had to tell others about making me embarrassed and even more socially anxious than I already am.
this is how she treated HER kids, but her kids also grew up with it and don't have adhd and asd growing up, so I'd imagine it'd be easier for them. Anyways


So a couple of weeks ago me and my dad decided we were gonna see my siblings kid on her ""gymnastics-dance"" competition. Right of the bat when I found out my step mom is coming with I got really anxious but brushed it off as it's only for a day and I hadn't seen her in ages.
I decided I might as well be nice and greet her, there's no reason for me to act rude because she hadn't exactly been bothering me much since me and my dad moved.
 we didn't have a great start. I was ready the desired time but my dad didn't seem in a rush so I grabbed some extra stuff like earrings and stuff to make sure I had everything. We left at like 10 minutes later and went to pick my step mom up, when we arrived at her place she made a snarky comment about, she said, and i quote: ""i didn't expect y'all to leave on time anyways so I didn't bother waiting in the same spot"". my dad responded that it was his fault we went off late bc it seemed a little early to leave, she didn't respond.
During the whole trip she barely talked to me but made many snarky comments to both me and my dad.  she asked why he hadn't fixed the car window yet and he responded that he hasn't found the time, she said: ""just like everything else you 'don't have time with' bc you're infront of your tv whenever you don't have work"" and after lunch when we were standing up she said ""come on push in your chair, you're not at home anymore"" (mind you my dad was on his way to push in the chair),she was practically mocking him for HIS lifestyle and the only time she seemed happy about was seeing my sister. 
Otherwise all she did was compare my sisters child to me and talk about how bad of a parent my dad was when I was younger.

1jzwqeh,AITA for not being totally honest to my friends in regards to my university course?,"
I made a few close friends within this course. They were very different type of people in comparison to myself in terms of personality. They were outgoing, extroverted and could say their mind whereas I was always pretty introverted and more quiet. We always got on pretty well. They would often talk constantly about going on dates/hooking up with diff people every week and would discuss and joke about a lot of se*ual stuff just in general. I was never really the type of person to be interested in going on dates with diff people and just all that in general. I should have probably communicated this better but anyways.

We went on a friends holiday back in August 2024, during our annual leave from university. Fast forward this holiday happens and I’m not going to go into too much detail about it, let’s just say I was made to feel very uncomfortable when we would go out at night and they would leave me in the club by myself whilst they all went and sat outside. This made me feel very uncomfortable 

Anyways ever since then I saw a different side to them, and the way this worked, we went on this 2 week holiday and then straight back to university so I personally felt as though I hadn’t really had any time to myself to think things through properly and self reflect on just everything going on including my stress with the uni course. The term passes by (5/6 weeks of theory) and I am spending time with these people a good few times a week. There were occasional times where I felt mildly uncomfortable by a remark that one of them would say to me (this happened on the trip as well) and through time it’s almost as if I felt nervous to be around them. As though I couldn’t be my true self.

So anyways few weeks pass by and I go into a depressive state, again, to cut a long story short, I make the decision to go ahead and leave the course without telling any of them. I leave the groupchat which prompts them to ask me why. A couple of months pass by since talking to them and I feel much more at peace. However they invite me out for a birthday night out (my birthday). Why I said yes I don’t know, but anyways I was looking forward to it not realising how it was gonna go.

Basically for the couple of hours we were out for the main topic of the conversation was why I left university (despite me having told them in our personal group chat beforehand), they couldn’t understand why I had done it, why I hadn’t told them, admitted it was a “kick in the teeth” for them to have found out “through others”. I felt bad then at the time but now I’m just generally curious to know. I will admit I should have been more upfront about everything at the time and used my voice more but I personally didn’t feel like I could, and that they would’ve disregarded it anyways.

1jzr9so,AITA - Bachelorette Party Planning Edition,"EDIT: Appreciate all of the opinions, just want to clarify something. She never said before booking she was uncomfortable, only after. Sure, maybe I should’ve shown everyone the plan before hand and that’s where I messed up and I’ll own that. However, nobody asked me to help plan, nobody volunteered extra ideas when asked so I went off the surveys and feedback I did have. Also, it’s a super popular show and not a strip club lol audience participation is 100% optional and we’re not hitting the ATM for singles and paying for private dances in the back?

—

I am the Maid of Honor in my best friend's wedding that's happening this July, and she has tasked be with planning out a long weekend in Vegas for her bachelorette trip (Friday night to Monday morning). In planning, we (the bride and I) sent out a survey this last December for all of the other bridesmaids to fill out (5 others). In this survey we asked for budget on lodging, budget on activities, activities they would recommend us doing, and activities they either didn't want to do/didn't feel comfortable doing. In getting these surveys back, most of the girls in their reply said it would be so fun to go to a male revue show, except for one girl. This one girl, we can call her Ana, left both of the activity categories blank but filled out every other question about budget so we know she 1) read it and 2) actually put some thought into her answers.

As I am booking, I'm trying to keep most things a surprise for the bride (per her request) and am planning away. I'm really taking the answers in the survey and budgets to heart as I'm trying to piece together this trip for 7 girls located across the US. I booked a table share  one night, a nice dinner another, and a few other more affordable brunch/dinner things as well as am working with promoters to get us into other clubs for free to help make it as affordable as possible but while still checking all of the boxes of a Vegas bachelorette. I, of course, booked a male revue show (Thunder Down Under) because the bride loves Australia, she's been and wants to go back and a revue show would be so fun and she is so so down, as is just about everyone else. I book it, sent the other girls their share of tickets, and Ana reaches out to the bride and 1) spoils the surprise, but 2) says she's really not comfortable going.

I already bought the tickets and am pretty sure they're nonrefundable, but that's whatever I'll probably just eat the cost of it. But what really makes me wonder if ITA, is that she is now going to be by herself after dinner if we don't change the plans. Should I have asked the group specially about attending a show like this before booking? My assumption was that if they were really not wanting to go/uncomfortable they would've voiced that in the survey. But I know what they say about assuming.....but bffr it's a Vegas bachelorette!!

But what really gets me is that Ana dumped this whole sappy story on the bride and then I had to reach out to Ana and say it's fine, yada yada, we'll miss you, let me know if you change your mind sort of thing. But like.........the surprise is ruined and the bride feels bad someone is going to be alone and this all IMO could've been avoided if she had just said something. I should also reiterate that the bride chose to do Vegas for her bachelorette because she wanted to do the stereotypical things- she wanted to party she wanted to go to shows and she wanted to have a fun, 20-something, Vegas bachelorette party.

But she still goes beyond their choices for going off with friends when she's supposed do piano lessons. My sister said she wanted to dye her hair too, and started yelling and crashing out.

1jz422w,AITA for not giving my cousin the chance to apologize for something she said about me behind my back?,"I (25F) took some time off work to help a family member with medical issues, and after that, I had a really hard time finding steady work. For months, I did odd jobs, but nothing in my field was working out.

One day, I went to hang out with my friend (25F), we'll call her Kate, to catch up. Kate and I were just sitting around talking since I didn’t have the money to do anything else. During the hangout, my cousin (also 25F) called Kate and she answered the phone on speaker without telling my cousin I was in the room. The second my name came up in the conversation, my cousin started going off about how I should just ""get a fast food job"" or something to make money and stop complaining about not being able to do anything. She continued with, ""It's not fair to the rest of us that we can't have fun because OP chooses to be broke.""

I was totally shocked. My cousin and I have always been close—like best friends. We grew up together, went to college in the same city, and have always supported each other. So hearing her say that was incredibly hurtful, especially considering she’s always been empathetic. She had also recently found a job in her high-demand field very quickly, which made her comment feel even more dismissive, given that my career path is harder to break into.

Kate quickly ended the call and apologized, but I was devastated. I didn’t want my cousin to know that I overheard, so I asked Kate not to tell her. Since then, I’ve been distant from my cousin. I’ve told my immediate family about what happened, but they think I’m being dramatic and that I should tell her what happened and let her apologize. The thing is, I don’t know if I could trust an apology after hearing that.

1jz3s9f,AITA for Wanting a Partial Refund on Shoes I Bought on Vinted Bc They Had Chewed Gum on the Bottom?,"I (40/F) have purchased some shoes for my daughter (1/F) on Vinted, which if you’re not in the UK is like Poshmark. I’ve had pretty good luck with infant and toddler clothes because kids often wear things 1-2 times before they outgrow them. 

Anyway, she’s starting to walk, so she now needs shoes with actual soles. I bought her a pair of converse online that were half the price of new ones. They didn’t look like they had been worn more than 1-2 times and were listed in very good condition, no photo of the soles and no mention of the gum (just adding that on sites like this, listing imperfections is expected so you can make an informed decision).

When I got the shoes, there was a big chunk of dried, chewed gum on the bottom as though the previous child had stepped in it, but everything else was fine. I started to try to remove it and got some off, then remembered to snap a photo. I looked at the listing again, and there was no mention of it and no photo of the soles.  

I requested a full refund by accident and the seller then responded saying she wanted the shoes back. I told her I was sorry and that I wanted to keep them and don’t think a full refund is warranted, but £5 or so would do as I paid £20 shipped. 

She responded telling me she was shocked I would ask for any money off and if I want to keep them, it can’t be that bad. She said it was “a little something sticky” and that if I don’t like it, I can send them back to her and she’ll find someone who will appreciate them. 

I’ve gotten quite frustrated because Vinted keeps telling me to click a button I literally cannot find in order to report that we can’t agree. 

My husband (35/m) told me that it was just gum on a shoe and not to get so worked up. Like, I know people are dying, etc., but AITA? Should this be expected? I’ve had a lot of luck here first year with stuff on there and never had something like this happen.

1jyrnnl,AITA for shouting at a taxi driver?,"Me (22F) and three other friends from university (Emma, Celine and Jesslyn, all 22-23F) went to an amusement park together. We decided to take a taxi back afterwards, and went to the taxi stand to queue up.

  
A taxi arrived, and Jesslyn walked over to the front passenger seat, while the other three of us slid in from the driver's side (the right side, as our country is a right-hand drive). We had a few bags, so it took some time. Once Jesslyn got in and shut the front passenger door, the driver started preparing to leave, and moved forward maybe 20-30cm. However, Celine had one foot in the taxi and one foot still out, and I hadn't even gotten in yet. Celine screamed when the taxi moved and the driver stopped, turned and said, 'Oh sorry, I didn't realize you guys hadn't all gotten on yet. I wasn't paying attention' or something to that extent.

  
I shouted at the driver, saying that it was irresponsible of him to drive off when not all of us had gotten on, that Celine could have gotten injured, and that I would never get on such a dangerous driver's taxi. Celine told me to stop it and get on, but I said that I didn't want to risk a road accident because the driver didn't 'pay attention'. The security guard came over and apologized, told us to get off, asked the taxi driver to leave, and ushered us to another taxi.

  
On the way back, Celine and Emma were telling me that I should have just gotten on the taxi because it was a genuine mistake and Celine wasn't injured anyway, that I was being mean for shouting at the poor taxi driver and wasted his time, and that we could all just laugh it off as a funny incident.

1jyhtxt,AITA for ignoring my little brother's demands?,"I (25F) live with my aunt and uncle and their two kids (15F, 3M). My aunt us in the middle of changing jobs, and has been helping her boss-to-be clean up her workplace in preparation for the summer kids, and my 15yo sister is helping her boyfriend at a wrestling show. So, I was in charge of the 3yo for today. He was hungry and so was I, so I made hotdogs for myself and prepared cheese, oranges and an Uncrustable for the kid.

When we eat at the table we all wait until everyone is served to eat. I had my brother drag the highchair to the table (it's light and he can easily push it) while I made the food. I got him situated and gave him his water while he waits because we want him to work on his abismal patience level.

While I was cutting up his sandwich he started banging on the table yelling ""Mine!"" ""Now!"" and ""Eat!"". I told him no and that he would wait until his lunch was ready. He kept yelling so I ignored him and brought our plates out once they were ready. He has a silicone plate that we suction cup to the table when we all eat together, and several times while I was trying to eat my own food he tried to pick his plate up from the table and play with it, so I had to stop what I was doing to put it back down, which made him yell ""No, mine!"" every single time.

1k6fy1x,AITA for offering to buy my friend drinks and study,"For context, I (18F) and D (19F) have been friends since sophomore year of high school. Among me and my close friends, it’s kind of become a tradition to share locations—it’s not a big deal, more like a trust thing. D and I had each other’s locations, but she got paranoid that I was “stalking her” after I mentioned that I’ll sometimes check if she’s in class before asking to hang out. I’ve only done this maybe once, but I get why that might feel weird. I told her she didn’t have to share her location and that I rarely check it anyway.

Two days ago, I asked D to study with me and even offered to buy us Starbucks since she was low on flex (meal plan money). I called her, got no answer, and left a voicemail jokingly saying “b!tch how come you ain't answering me.” This is clearly a joke between us—I’d never swear at her seriously. She had texted me “I’m in class,” so I just texted her my plans and waited for a response.

After a while, I realized her class would’ve ended based on the schedule I know. Since she used class as the reason earlier, I asked why she was ignoring me—yeah, maybe that’s an overstep, but we’re super close and it felt off. Plus, she gets super mad when *I* don’t respond, so it felt like a double standard. All I wanted was a simple “oh sorry I made plans with other people” so I could make other plans too.

Her response? “I'm turning my f*cking location off I'm with people stfu.” That really upset me. She hasn’t been acting like a good friend lately, and since she joined this bigger friend group, it feels like she treats me as disposable. Normally I’d let something like this go, but this time I called her out. I told her I knew she was out of class based on the block times and said her response was rude and embarrassing—especially considering she thought she was so special that I’d check her location like that.

She tried to defend herself by saying I was $h!+ talking her in my voicemail and was mad I cursed. But based on the tone, what I said, and the fact that she’s laughed at stuff like this before, I *do not* believe that’s really what upset her. I then sent her a long message—about 7 paragraphs—explaining everything that’s been bothering me about our friendship lately. Her only reply was one sentence: she was sorry she snapped and misinterpreted my voicemail. She completely ignored everything else I said.

I called her out again, but what hurts more is the idea that if she hadn’t “misinterpreted” my voicemail, would she have even responded at all? Or did she only reply to tell me to F off?

EDIT: She said “I’m in class” as to why she couldn’t answer my calls so that’s why I texted. Based on the class schedule I knew it ended in ten minutes and we are VERY CLOSE so when she was ignoring me I knew something was up so I asked. That’s when she flipped out and turned location off",AmItheAsshole,LavenderLeaf24,7,0.82,32,2025-04-24 01:20:10+00:00,Asshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k6fy1x/aita_for_offering_to_buy_my_friend_drinks_and/,True,Asshole
1k6f02g,AITA for placing my carry-on bag in an overhead compartment for a row I wasn’t sitting in?,"I (30 M) was on a flight the other day and my seat was all the way in the back- row 42. While I was boarding the plane, I placed my carry on bag in the overhead compartment for row 27 on the way back to my seat. I figure this isn’t a big deal as it’s first come first serve with overhead space and I saw open space where my bag would fit just fine. For context, I truly don’t believe your seat assignment also applies to open overhead space. I see overhead space as more so communal.

However, a middle aged guy (56?M) was already sitting in row 27 (the whole row was already seated by the way) and wasn’t happy that I was doing this. This guy was being passive aggressive saying “this is row 27.” He was more or less insinuating that I wasn’t aware of this and my carry on had no business being placed above his row. 

I didn’t think much of it and just carried on as this guy doesn’t own the plane and I believe it really doesn’t matter where you place your carry on as the overhead space is not assigned like a seat is. 

Fast forward to deboarding the plane, I go to row 27 to get my carry on and notice the compartment is already closed. I figure the same guy who was being passive aggressive about me placing my carry on in this row was still salty. This was his way of trying to teach me a lesson by closing the compartment even though my luggage was still in there. AITA?

1k6ejuh,WIBTA? My brother accidentally sent money to the wrong Zelle account,"Hello! First time posting and wasn't sure how to tag the title, looking for some clarity in an odd situation. Long story shorter my brother has diamond status at Caesars so he gets really good discounts on rooms at their properties. He offered to help me book a room for a trip in June, was saving me like $300-$400 on a 5 night stay which was awesome! We had to put down a refundable deposit on the room of $230. Had him book it and sent him the depo money through Zelle.

I had to rearrange this trip and had to cancel that booking which no big deal because the deposit is refundable. He got the refund and said he sent me the money through Zelle. I check the next morning and don't see a deposit back, check through alerts and whatnot, nothing. I text him to ask and he sends me the receipt for the transfer. Somehow he sent it to my old work phone number. I haven't had that number in 3+ years and don't know how he even has it because I've had the same personal cell number for like 12 years but that's what was in his Zelle contact which is weird because the last like dozen plus times I've sent him money has been through Zelle from my current phone number and account. You can't reverse a Zelle transaction at all, it's gone once you send it. I tried calling the person he sent it to, left a vm but I'm obviously not very hopeful of getting it back from a random who doesnt even have their name in their VM. He's saying it's my fault for not letting him know I don't have that number any more. WHAT??? I told him that i get it, mistakes happen and ask him to split it with me, he said no. We're both mid 30's and make $200k+ so the $230 or $115 doesn't really affect either us. For me it's just the principal of it, he literally threw the money away, is blaming me for it and won't even split it with me. On the other hand he was trying to help me out by saving money on a room booking. We were never close growing up but when we got into our mid 20's we finally got over that and became friends. I stay at his house when I'm in his town and etc so I don't want to make a big deal out of this but WIBTA if push him to make things right? How am I supposed to know to tell him I don't have this old phone number when I have no idea why he has it? We don't ever talk or text on that number, I'm at a loss on that.

1k6d8jb,"AITA for pointing out the danger in his ""funny story""?","My mother and I babysit my niece Luna (3), and have babysat since she was born. I've always been there and I've always gone out of my way to help

Today we went to babysit and my brother in law Jake started to tell a ""funny story""  from earlier in the day. The story was, "" I was in the kitchen making my self lunch and Luna was by herself in the living room. I got done making my food and went and sat down with her and after a little while I noticed her messing with her nose, so I started looking and she has a whole sucker wrapper stuck in there. I couldn't get it out so I called Kat (Luna's mom, my sister). She came home from work with a medical balloon to get it out."" And that was it.

I do not like Jake, he's been careless with Luna multiple times by being careless.

I was so upset so I got up and walked away. I ended up just washing my hands mumbling under my breath ""or just watch your fucking kid, its not that hard."" I really didn't think he heard this part but idk. My niece is trying to get me back to the living room where him and my mom are talking about it. I go with her hoping they'll change the subject. They're still on it, he's chuckling, my mom's nodding, she's either on the same page as me, or she can tell I'm about to speak up, I look at him blank faced and tell him "" That's really dangerous dude what if it was a magnet or a battery or something?""  And then silence. Eventually Luna breaks the silence and he ends up leaving for work.

Kat gets home and instantly starts shit. She says something similar has happen under my mom's watch, I say that that was a bead that could easily slip into her nose, not a candy wrapper she'd have to spend a good period of time shoving up there, and that my mom was watching when it happened, it just happened too fast. She's real heated and is raising her voice louder in front of Luna saying, "" How long do you think it take to cook, clean, shit-"" I cut her off just saying ""How long does it take a baby to die?"" She then starts fully yelling, "" You need to stop disrespecting out parenting were both basically single parents if you don't like how i'm raising my daughter then you cant leave and not come back just stop coming over.""

Edit/ update: Cannot delete post yet, so I took stuff that everyone was focused on instead of the actual AITA. I grew up with a stoner parent and thats not the dangerous part, his being a dumbass is. After talking to my mom I learned Kat said same thing happened with my mom, but my mom gave her something with beads that broke while Jake was supposed to be watching. And Jake was laughing so much because he was scared my mom would ripe him a new one. Calling cps is not something I'd even consider.

1k6csvh,AITA ex wife addition,"Aita?? My husband was married before and had two children with his first wife. We have been married for 7 years and have two young kids of our own. He shares 50-50 custody with his ex-wife of their two sons and They live with us half the week and have been since they were 3 and 4 years old. They are now 12 and 14 years old and their mother had two kids with her second husband. The divorce was very bitter and dont have a good coparenting relationship. Even after all these years, it still gets very nasty between them and it's something that will never change. When I was in the hospital, giving birth to our first son she refused to take her two sons our custody days being I was in the hospital, giving birth. No reason given, she went against their settlement agreement that if one of the parents can't exercise their parenting time due to an emergency the other parent takes the kids. She refused her two sons during the time I was in the hospital Putting my husband in a very tough situation. Fast-forward, she does not recognize my two sons. ever. She doesnt acknowledge them or speak to them if at same event. To be fair, she doesn't speak to me either. My husband is genuinely a nice guy, but also has a lot of insecurity from that marriage. She's a dominant personality, was the breadwinner, put him down a lot. Whenever he sees her two kids he's always very polite and says hello. Which is fine. But do you think he should go out of his way for them? For example, we were all at the same event and one of her children was having a tantrum. My husband happened to be there and witnessed the tantrum and being the nice guy he is said if you stop crying, I'll give you a ride in the golf cart around the field where they were watching The older boys play a game. He tells me the story later on to which I didn't have much to say. he asked why I was quiet and I just thought it was unnecessary to take the kids on a golf cart ride being that she is disrespectful and doesn't acknowledge our two younger sons. To put in reference our kids are 3 and 4 and hers are 4. I told my husband you do you. But she has disrespected our family and doesnt acknowledge our 2 sons so I wouldnt go out of my way for hers. He thinks I'm being ridiculous and that their children and nothing to do With the issues that are already there. I agree and just wave and say hi but that's it. My loyalty is to my children.in my husband's mind those two boys are his son's half brothers which means family and he wants his kids and those kids to see that he's a good guy and can put differences aside.

My younger siblings are graduating high school next month, and due to my chronic illnesses, I'm unable to attend their graduation. I'm proud of them both and wish I could be there, but the ceremony starts at 7pm and I wouldn't be able to make it through without getting really sick.

I'm a crocheter, so I'm making them little graduation cap pins to wear on their graduation night. Honestly, there isn't much of a difference in the quality of the crochet caps--they're well made, the embroidery is neat, and I've been crocheting for five years so I trust my skills. The only thing is that it's a new pattern I'm designing, so I'm making little changes here and there as I go. For the record, I did a test of the pattern first and I have never made pins before. The actual pin part is a first for me.

I suffer from contamination ocd so being a ocd person,i avoid going out.Being out and being contaminated by germs gives me panic and anxiety attack.My sister wanted me to take our mom to hospital.I was not comfortable going to a hospital.I tried explaining but it resulted in huge fight and they guilt tripped me into going saying how i dont care for my mom ,how i am being selfish and all that ..Eventhough i was scared i went for my mom.It was nerve wracking and worst experience for me.It took me couple weeks to recover from that.

Yesterday,my mom had appointment for her uterine prolapse checkup.My sister and mom again said me to go with mom.I am on second day of my periods.I have pcod too so my periods flow and cramps are always worse for me.I am physically mentally drained on my period.This time i stood my ground and said no.I said i have my periods cramps.I cant travel in a car for 6hours straight with my period,no way of changing pad.I hate going in public washroom because of my ocd.since we are in a rural area and the hospital we booked takes 6h to reach.

This too resulted in a huge fight.My mom started crying like how i dont care for her. no one is there to take her.I told both my sister to go with mom but they refused.Both of their husband returned from abroad so they said they have to spend time with them.Which is a lame excuse.But my mom finds my reasoning as selfish and started crying.

1k6bxmx,AITA for snapping at my mom after she tried to force me to learn sign language?,"My (13M) mom (35F) has been dating with her now fiancé (38M) (let’s call him Jeremy) for two years. Five months ago he proposed her and they got engaged, and moved in together, and now they are planning their wedding. I am cool with this. I really like Jeremy, they were friends before they started dating, so I met and got close to him before he started dating my mom. I think he’s really cool and I am happy for my mom. 

My issue is with his annoying and arrogant son, he is only 2 years older than me but acts like he’s too cool to hang out with me. He treats me like a little kid but there’s only 2 years between us.

I will call him Dean. Dean is deaf, and has to use a device (it’s called cochlear implants) to hear. But he can’t wear his device all the time because apparently hearing can be exhausting for him. Tbh I think this is an excuse he uses to avoid hanging out with us. But that’s what he claims. 

Anyway he and Jeremy both know sign language but my mom and I don’t. My mom has started learning after she got engaged with Jeremy and she’s pressuring me to learn too but I’m refusing because i don’t want to spend my time learning a whole language for him when he clearly doesn’t even like me. 

My mom says I am being disrespectful because we now basically live semi together. (He comes to stay with Jeremy on the weekends. I live with my mom full time. So unfortunately I have to stay with Dean on weekends) 

Two days ago my mom (in front of Jeremy btw) started telling me about this great ASL tutor she found online and how she’s thinking sign me up for her classes.

I, my girlfriend (Whitney), my local/birthday friend (Ryan), another local friend (Marilyn) and out-of-town visiting friend (Jake) met up at a big event today. I had originally told Ryan that after the event, we would be going out to dinner somewhere (location up in the air) and then I'd treat Ryan to a birthday dessert. I told him we would be going to dinner at around 6-7pm, and we could meet at the event.

Ryan met us at the event and we hung out for a while. Jake went to his hotel, as he was exhausted and needed a nap. Whitney and Marilyn weren't hungry, but Ryan was starving. He said he hadn't eaten much all day and was famished. Whitney suggested we go to the restaurant and bring home anything we didn't eat there, but I was unsure. Jake had texted me and ""really wanted to have dinner with us"", and he wouldn't be ready to eat for at least 1.5 hours.

I felt stuck in the middle, and told Ryan we could do another time, as Jake was out of town and Ryan was local, so I could see Ryan anytime. Ryan seemed disappointed, especially as we discovered both our schedules would be incompatible for a while. After some discussion, Ryan said he was exhausted and would go home, and we could just do the dinner/dessert another time. I felt bad, but thanked him for his understanding. After he got home, I texted him, but he's been quiet since then.

It was a hard situation for me because I didn't want to let Jake down, especially he was visiting from out of town, but I do feel like I let Ryan down in the end.

He'll often run it for at least over an hour at a time, if not several, without any interruption or break. The amount of time the thing is on greatly eclipses the time that it's off.

I try to ignore it, but half the time the heater's fan is pointed away from me, so I get the full noise in the background for however long. It's extremely distracting and frustrating to me, even with noise-cancelling headphones. I've mentioned it to him a few times, but he usually brushes it off or doesn't think much of it.

Moving desks isn't much of an option because of complicated stuff having to do with our company's contracts and divisions and stuff.

1k67e4h,AITA - Taking an open office at my company despite not having seniority,"I recently moved to a smaller building at the large company I’ve been with for 5 years. There is a small area I’m in that they have us 4 analyst/engineers work domicile from (all on different teams). Two are in the field a lot and I don’t have any issue with this about. The other person is my same lvl but has worked in the building full time longer and is much older

When I got my desk I notice there is an unused office with a view. I asked the other person why nobody takes it? They said it’s been unused for almost a year but only managers can have offices. 

Anyways a few weeks later my boss visited and I joked (knew what I was doing) that I wanted to steal the office till it was assigned and he said I definitely should. 

So anyways, I told the person I was thinking of using the office till assigned but specifically said to them “unless you want it, as you have seniority”. They said no, it’s not allowed and there manager said no one should use it. Anyways my manager is slightly higher than hers, so I just took it and said if anyone kicks me out it’s no biggie.

Now she is apparently upset with me and one of the engineers who is my buddy said she complained about me to him. 

Am I the AITA. Writing this from the office, lol.

1k62xhx,AITA for communicating boundaries?,"I (15M) experience issues with chronic pain and mental illness. A while back I had 2 weeks of the worst chronic pain I’ve experienced. I decided to make a group chat with my friend, salt (16M) and pepper (14M) to communicate how I’ve been feeling.

I made the group chat and of course asked if I could talk about my issues and setting some boundaries, waiting for their responses before I went on a rant.

Keep in mind with pepper our friendship at this point was getting stale; they had stopped texting me so often and we don’t share any classes together, so it was like I barely knew them anymore.

Around 2 hours after I had wrapped up talking about my problems, and some kind and encouraging words were exchanged, pepper had texted me ranting about their home life, saying how they wanted to die because of how horrible their mom is, etc.

I was caught extremely off guard because they have never opened up like that before. I would constantly ask them if they were ok and they would always dodge the question or say they were. My immediate response was “I’m not sure how to respond.” This friend deliberately never talked like this so I found it odd.
I then said “maybe next time you vent you could ask me.” I think the way I phrased this originally wasn’t the best, but I had meant it in a way that they tell me before they rant about severe issues like that, just so I could be prepared.

After this had happened we barely talked at all, barely messaged, nothing. I had considered heavily of unfriending them as I felt it wasn’t going anywhere; and I was frustrated that they never talked to me.

They chalked up the lack of interaction to mental health issues, which makes sense, if they weren’t posting on their story photos of them and their friends (new ones). I get you can not like someone but they were deliberately saying nothing was wrong each time I asked.

The other day I asked “are you mad at me?” (I know that comes off as very insecure, and to be honest I am) and they answered “what? no.”
Pepper texts in all lowercase with autocorrect off, so I could tell when his partner logs in to his account and is messaging me because he uses correct grammar and auto capitalizes.

They then said “You never let me vent even though you constantly want me to open up” which was confusing because I had said once to ask before they proceed.

Yesterday they said they no longer wanted to be friends, continued to say I wasn’t a good friend and stated they were mad at me. I had asked “why didn’t you say this when I gave you the opportunity to talk about it?” And then they LITERALLY SAID “because I have a hard time telling the truth to people, because I didn’t want to lose you.”

Im lost because that seems to me like they should’ve communicated when they were upset with me, but never did. I just want to know if and how I was in the wrong.",AmItheAsshole,ContestOk9033,3,0.61,18,2025-04-23 16:04:40+00:00,Asshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k62xhx/aita_for_communicating_boundaries/,True,Asshole
1k60slv,WIBTA - If I asked my coworking to stop giving me morning greetings everyday,"We recently joined two teams together and the manager of the other team is now on my team.

Every morning that former manager sends me a Direct message on Teams . Its been 2 months and I have 40 or so unique greetings. For the first week, I responded, then just thumbs up, and now I just ignore them.

We already have a morning virtual stand up (remote office) and I would rather not get the message at all becausel 1) Pressured to respond 2) Feel bad for not responding 3) Sometimes I'm not having a good day 4) don't see the point - we will see each other on video chat within the hour where we will do the exact same small talk greetings.

Each day the greeting is different and says something like

Good morning \_\_\_, hope you had a good night rest!  
Good morning \_\_\_\_, hope you had a nice night!  
Good morning \_\_\_, hope you had a restful night!  
Good morning \_\_\_ Hope you had a nice weekend!  
Good morning \_\_\_, hope the issues are getting resolved (I had taken the day off for family issues - the issue was not possible to resolve)

Would I be the asshole if on a call I asked if we could just stick to morning greetings during our standup. If so, what is the best way to do this

Update

Thanks for all the responses. From the responses, Good points brought up   
  
1. I think it would be better if its was a simple good morning versus something borderline personal.   
  
For example, Hope you got your issues resolved (I had a passing in the family on that one). Hope you had a resful night. If I had responded in ernest, I'd be talking why I didn't? 

2. Its more annoying as its done before work starts - usually its the first message I see on my phone 

3. We do this same dance on our stand up



However, even such, I do agree with everyone, it's not worth it and I should not feel bad for ignoring. There were decent solutions given if I could mention (if this conversation topic comes up.

1. Mention that you don't do well with small talk on messages (they may get the hint)  
2. Talk about it with other team members -> if everyone is annoyed, then maybe we can chat about the best ways to use Teams (not talk about this directly but say keep DMS about business and keep them short and sweet) [https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/blog/collaboration/etiquette-tips-in-slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/blog/collaboration/etiquette-tips-in-slack) <- like slack/teams suggest",AmItheAsshole,doug_o_mania,5,0.54,68,2025-04-23 14:38:32+00:00,Asshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k60slv/wibta_if_i_asked_my_coworking_to_stop_giving_me/,True,Asshole
1k5zqri,AITA for making my 12 year old go on vacation?,"My 12 year has band camp coming up at the end of this summer. My ex and I booked vacations for our weeks before we knew when camp was (since it's his first year).  He's now saying that he wants to stay home both weeks and do band camp. 

My ex has given me this speech about how she feels it's a mature thing that he is doing and that she supports his decision. She won't cancel her vacation and will still go with her husband, stepson, and our son. She will just have him stay with someone that week who can take him and pick him up.

1k5uldx,WIBTA if I asked my dad to pay for my friend’s part of the vacation?,"Here is some context:

My (19M) dad’s (39) birthday is coming up, his 40th. A couple of months ago he had told me he had planned to celebrate by hosting a party the day of as well as taking a trip at the end of the month. He told me that we would drive to an airbnb and stay for the weekend, and that I was allowed to bring a friend. 

Here’s the thing: he told me that whoever I invited would need to cover their part of the trip ($600 USD) which covers food, travel, and part of the airbnb, as well as whatever additional cash they need for souvenirs or other things. I told him that my friends probably wouldn’t be able to pay that much, but I would still ask. 

I asked my two closest friends but neither are able to afford to go. When I told my dad, the only response I get is “FFS!”
 
I have started to become conflicted, since he has told me that he wants me to go on the trip (and I want to go as well) but he wants me to bring someone my age so I am not stuck with a bunch of adults twice my age (which I agree with).

Here is where I might be the asshole. I want to ask him to cover the cost of whichever friend I bring with me. 

I understand that it is his money, but I think it is a little rude to invite someone on a trip and then ask them to cover their part, especially knowing their financial situation. It was not planned to include one of my friends, only after my dad invited me.

On top of this I know that my dad could cover the cost. Not only is he planning on throwing a party with all of his friends in state, but he has also made financial choices that I won’t be getting into due to personal situations. 

I don’t want to sound entitled, but I also don’t think it is fair to ask my friends to pay for their part when I have told my dad that they probably wouldn’t be able to anyway.

As of right now I am still going on the trip, but I have no one to bring and it would just be my dad, some family, and a couple of his close friends. 

Would I be the asshole to if I asked my dad to pay for my friend’s part of the vacation?

1k5q6xf,AITA for refusing to buy my girlfriend her ticket to our senior prom?,"earlier today my gf and i (both 18) got into a fight about senior prom tickets. we have been together for a while now and we decided to go to prom together. 

tickets are being sold this week for $25 a person. i mentioned that i was only planning on paying for my ticket, not hers. this surprised her, because she just assumed that i would pay for them. she seemed sort of shocked and got weirdly sad. i felt like it was really rude of her to assume that i was going to pay for them just because im the guy. 

i asked her why it had to be my responsibility since we BOTH wanted to go. i told her that i thought she was being sort of unreasonable and outdated. i also reminded her that i paid for her prom flowers. 

well that really pissed her off. she told me that we spent the same amount of money on each others respective flowers. then she reminded me that her dress was $750, not including all of her extra stuff, and that i didn’t have to buy anything new for prom. she also pointed out that her parents were paying for dinner so she didn’t understand why i was being so cheap when she’s already made this as affordable as possible. 

i already spent like $25 on her prom proposal sign. i don’t want to spend extra money on prom. i don’t even want to go that bad. i’m only going because i want to be with her. plus i always pay for our dates and drive us (that she never compensates me for). 

she’s very mad at me and telling me that im
not acting like myself. she’s from a very rich family and i feel like she’s acting entitled and spoiled. am i cheap asshole? or is she being a bratty bitch?


EDIT: since i’m being attacked. i do love my gf im just frustrated at her entitlement. 

calling her a bitch was wrong. 

my gf is very beautiful. many people have told me she’s out of my league. she’s aware of these comments and still chose to insult me otp. her insults were very creative and long but the gist was that she prays i don’t age like my dad, my hairline is receding, and that i need to learn to control my temper. 

we both love each other we are just upset and have conflicting opinions. 


also tickets would be $50 total. plus i have to drive her to and from prom dinner. we are taking her car bc she drives a nicer car but still feel like it’s worth mentioning. 


FINAL EDIT: 
this post was not meant to turn into a debate about patriarchy and gender roles. i was raised with traditional values and normally pride myself for the way i treat her. i do NOT mind paying for our dates, i mentioned it as context. i always walk her to and from the car, i hold doors, i carry her stuff, i try to be a gentleman whenever possible. clearly i fucked up.

 she is so kind and beautiful. i have no intention of breaking up with her and i hope she’s on the same page. 

she is my first ever gf. and im like her seventh bf. i get overwhelmed and confused with all of the things im supposed to do. i will buy her ticket. i have texted her multiple apologies and will apologize again tomorrow. i have flowers otw to her house to show good faith. 

after reading the comments, i realized that i fucked up. i don’t want to loose her over $25. you are all right. that is a dumb hill to die on. i don’t know why i got so upset about this. 

thank you all for your advice and honesty. the brutality was clearly needed. ",AmItheAsshole,Lemmanade26,0,0.45,148,2025-04-23 04:05:07+00:00,Asshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k5q6xf/aita_for_refusing_to_buy_my_girlfriend_her_ticket/,True,Asshole
1k5p8tr,AITA for the way I split rent?,"My partner (23m) and I (20f) have recently moved into a 3-bedroom house from a one-bedroom cabin. We moved for a few different reasons, the main one being that my partner's brother (24), who has autism, was living with a narcissist, his stepfather. The living situation was very unhealthy, so we agreed with the rest of his family to look for a place with him. My partner's grandfather said that he might know someone who's looking for tenants. We attended the viewing with the property agent and submitted the application online. I will admit that a huge part of how we got the rental is because of my partner's grandparents. However, the owner herself said that the biggest reason was the fact that my partner and I had an amazing reference from our previous landlord. I paid for the bond in full ($2,200) plus $300 for the advance. My partner's brother paid $250 towards the advance. The weekly rent is $550 p/w not including any bills. I divided it so that my partner, whom we will call Luke, and I paid $300 together, and his brother, whom we will call David, paid $250. I divided it this way because L and I own all of the communal things. The only thing David has any ownership of is the stuff in his room and part of the air fryer, fridge, and couch. The couch and air fryer were given to all three of us, and we are splitting the cost of the fridge. We would split the bills 3 ways. I feel like it's also important to note that only Luke and I are on the tenancy agreement. The issue started when Luke and David's uncle, whom we will call Mike, said that he had a problem with the amount of rent that David is paying. Mike is helping David with his finances because David can be very irresponsible with his money. Mike controls how much money goes into his savings account as well as setting up automatic payments and such. Mike wanted to have a meeting with Luke and David's Grandfather, whom we will call Poppa. M wanted to discuss why David was paying more than us even though we moved in together. I tried to explain my reasoning, but was shut down immediately by Poppa. He kept saying it all needs to be even and divided by three. I tried to say that Luke and I only take up one room, so why should we pay for two? I said if we are going by thirds, then L and I get the spare room for ourselves, and David can't use it at all. Since we are paying for two-thirds, we can take two-thirds of the rooms. Poppa and Mike kept saying that the spare room is a communal room and David has the right to use it. I said that he doesn't have the right to use it if I'm the one paying for it. It all ended up being a big argument with Poppa yelling at me. I'm not trying to scam David or use him for his money, but I don't want to be taken advantage of either. We take care of David by helping him with cooking, cleaning, personal hygiene, taking care of his cat, and taking him to work.

1k5p3mq,AITA My 17m son broke our agreement.,"My (54m) son has been letting his room go and it is absolutely filthy. It doesn’t have any food or anything like that, but it is incredibly cluttered with clothes, textbooks, used Kleenex and just in disarray.

The agreement was, I would give him 90 minutes of gaming on his laptop, I’m return for him going on an outdoor walk and then cleaning his room. 

For context:  he barely leaves the house and all he does is play video games. Except for when being punished for missing homework, and I take his things. At those times, he just sits in his room and does nothing, as far as I know.  

So, he gets his Computer time it was supposed to end at 7:00, which is actually 95 minutes. Any rate, I’m finishing my food, so I don’t go in there right away. I go in at 7:15 to tell him it’s time to turn the things off, which is 15 minutes after our agreed-upon time.

He says “give me a second.” He doesn’t ask. He tells me. Knowing his temperament, I decide this is the best course of action, which is pretty much how it always goes.  After a few moments, I got tired of waiting and told him he needed to turn it off. 

He countered with the fact that he was trying to exit the game, as in his character, leaving the area in a way that allowed him to save his progress.  After some back-and-forth, I insisted that he turned it off immediately.  

At which point, he turned it off, but declared he was not going on his walk or cleaning his room. He says it’s my fault.  

AITA?

1k5oxpg,WIBTA for not inviting my friend to my b-day party?,"so basically, i have this friend, lets call her ""Erica."" and every single year that she has been at my birthday i have cried atleast once. 

i know this may sound childish, but, i dont really care. Erica has always been somewhat entitled, sorta like when its her b-day she always gets whatever she wants. but, when its anyone elses, it doesnt matter. honestly, i dont even want to be friends with Erica, but im in a ""trio"" with her and another freind, lets call her ""Abe"" and she likes Erica. 

i know that Erica will be very mad if i dont envite her, but still. one time i cried because she just wouldnt listen, and kept on insisting to do things that i didnt want her to. again, this may sound childish but i have autism and like things to be about me when its on MY day. i am not like this at other people's occasions, because its THEIR occasion. another time i cried because she yelled at me for making a joke. 

honestly, i hate her. i just cant stop being freinds with her because of the whole trio thing. i just want my birthday to have no cries, and just be about me. Abe doesnt have this problem, she is respectful and shit, but Erica isnt. i could name so many other things i dont like about her. such as, she doesnt pick up after herself, doesn't respect boundaries, and the list goes on. point is, im pretty sure she would just ruin my birthday again. 

its not for like another 1-2 months, but still. anyways, i think i just wont invite her and invite one of my other friends.

1k5nm0q,WIBTA if I made my roommate pay half my rent?,"My roommate (22F) and I (23F) are graduating from college in a few weeks. We have been looking for subletters for our apartment and agreed that we would want to find two people to take over our lease for the summer. A few days ago she informed she that she found someone for her room and put him (21M) on the lease for the summer. 

Up until a few days ago I thought we were trying to find two people together so both our rooms were covered. She had a few leads that fell through (that she didn’t tell me about until days later after I prompted her) and I had a few leads but I had to deny them as her guy friend is now subletting her room. 

My roommate claims she doesn’t know anyone who wants to sublet my room (which makes it all the more difficult finding someone bc girls are wary of rooming with guys, even if the guy is LGBT). 

I’m desperately looking to find someone to sublet my room but my family is livid that she screwed me over and didn’t tell me before contacting our landlord. My parents help me pay the rent and are insisting that my roommate should pay half of my portion of the rent if I can’t find anyone to sublet my room. I get their sentiment but can’t shake the feeling that this would cause a big problem. WIBTA? 

EDIT: I had been the one in charge of finding two subletters but she had been helping out here and there. This was up until she switched it up on me a few days ago when she told me about her friend. 

Prior to this she had a few people she thought would take over so I rejected some solo offers for just my room. Then her leads fell through and I was stuck between a rock and a hard place bc I had just said no to people who were interested. 

The last few days I’ve been posting on social media like it’s my job to find someone new. I promise I’m not sitting on my ass wanting people to do work for me. The rent situation is absolute worst case scenario!

1k5k2a8,AITA for wanting my adult daughter to attend her cousin's wedding even though she's going through a rough patch?,"My (62 Female) daughter (27 Female) is going through a rough patch since she graduated college two years ago. She is currently unemployed, has had a string of bad jobs, having a career crisis, and going through some mental health problems, which she is trying to get under control now. She sees a therapist and has been bringing up some of her past, but seems to be doing good for the most part. She lives alone in a different state and is applying to jobs and living off her savings. 

The issue is that her cousin is getting married this Summer and she doesn't want to attend. I asked why, and she said she doesn't feel comfortable being around family right now because of her mental health and that she hasn't talked to this particular cousin since she was a little girl. This is true, they are not close at all and haven't talked in years to my knowledge. However, the whole extended family is going to be there, so this is upsetting for me as I think it would be healthy for her to be around them and connect with others. This is more a family reunion than a wedding. 

She tells me how the family wasn't there for her growing up. However, she has pushed her family away since she was a child. I've asked her a couple times now but she will not budge, and I've told her that she'd be the only one not attending. I did once call her and just told her she is going and she waivered a bit, but then she said no. I understand that this was wrong of me to do, but I just want her to go. 

 I'm trying to contain it, but I can't help but feel upset by this as we a re willing to pay everything for her to come to the wedding. She is upset that I keep mentioning it.

Now I do want to be vague because I don't want this coming back to me somehow lol but here's the story. My mom had asked me back in Feb to go on this trip and I didn't want to do it but I said Yes because  I felt like I had too. As time went on we had to send in some stuff to the organization but I just knew it wasn't something that I wanted to do at all. It's not that there's anything wrong with this organisation but it's not something I see myself in or doing. The plan is to go to this country to get our citizenship. My parents are both Carribean so we have no direct ties to any african countries. I do know that obviously Carribean people are from Africa orginally due to slavery but like to figure that out you would have to do a dna testing and both my parents and their families from where we can record where born in carribean countries. I have told my mom I don't want to be apart of it but each time she tells me it's my choice but becomes visibly upset that I change my mind, so I stay. My mom (and dad) are very pro-africa and there is nothing wrong with that, but I'm not really as deep as they are if that makes sense. I also have a feeling that mostly older people would be going there. My dad, due to his job is not coming along so it would really only be my mom and I and a bunch of other people I've never met. The trip is coming up pretty soon but we still don't know the days of when this is happening (just the month) so I can't even tell my job the days I would need to take off. ATP I'm willing to just pay my mom the money back of the things she did spend her money on (which isn't a ton atp) and just say I wasn't chosen to go or something. I fear I might be the a\*\*hole tho since I told my mom yes but I know it's not something I want to do and so idk what to do anymore. Please tell me your opinions even if it's blunt. Thank you.

1k5i5os,AITA for telling my grandparents what my sister studies?,"So for context, my sister studies 2 majors at once in college - one's a new one for her and it's a branch of medicine and the other one is just a language. My grandparents know that she studies that language, but know nothing about the medicine because she doesn't wanna tell them for some reason (something about being scared she's not gonna pass I think). And today me (18M) and my sister (20F) went to my grandpa's birthday party and our family from another country was there too. 

My sister was talking with our aunt that can't speak our language at all in their language and I heard her say something about her double majors and medicine. And she was also mentioning having an anatomy test tomorrow when we were talking to our cousin. So we were supposed to go back early with that cousin and when we went to say bye to grandma, she asked why we were leaving early. I told her me and our cousin were gonna study some math and then she asked if my sister was leaving too. She nodded yes and then I said that she wasn't gonna study math with us but anatomy for her test. And then she just kinda froze and tensed up and just went silent. And we finished talking, and she was still standing in one place not moving. 

And then I went up to her and she just said not even looking at me ""\[name\], what a slip up..."" and so I said sorry, but she didn't reply and just stood there staring up for another couple of minutes, then I saw her go outside in a rushed pace and she hung out there for a while. And she ended up deciding not to go back with us too, so I'm just kinda wondering if I'm the AH for what I said.

1k5grdk,AITAH for raising my voice at my mother for finding her booklet?,"I require social services and my mom was getting ready for our meeting with my worker. She asked me to look for her booklet in her drawer so I did. Problem tho is that I don’t know if it’s my autism or me having ADHD or something, but I couldn’t think of what a booklet looked like. I didn’t want to ask my mom to remind me as from past experiences she would get angry at me for asking such questions that I “should know about” when I literally don’t remember or my mind is somewhere else (this happens often). 

I try looking for the booklet that I couldn’t seem to know what it was at the time and my mom starts raising her voice, saying how it’s right there. I respond with a tone of my own that I don’t see it and she yells. I walk out with my stuff and wait for her to get ready to leave. After a few minutes of calming myself down with some YouTube videos, she calls me in her still annoyed tone if I got the keys. I immediately responded “NO” and she proceeds to tell me that maybe I should’ve since I was waiting outside. By the way, she parked the car outside the lot (we live in a studio apartment) and it was really hot outside and I didn’t want to sit in a car with two barely functioning windows. 

After she was ready and we walked to the car, she ask if I was going to change my attitude. I was really irritated, but I didn’t yell. I responded in a calm, though frustrated tone that she had to change. She then asked me if she had to take me to the bus stop so I can get to my college class and tell my worker that I couldn’t come because I was having an attitude. After talking back and forth for a few seconds, without yelling btw, I just got out of the car, grabbed my things and went back in the house (I forgot my lunch and didn’t tell her because I knew she would’ve just complained about that too). By the time I walked back outside, she was parking in front of the house. Saying nothing, I walked past her to the bus stop and am writing on said bus as I speak. 

Am I the asshole? 

Side note: Does my mother supposedly having an abusive mother of her own (I say supposedly because she’s always lecturing me and giving me ultimatums) and having lupus give her the right to be angry so much? 

Is the fact that I barely know how to talk at times, have autism and possibly ADHD not an excuse for me to feel defensive/offensive? 

Unsure if what I’m saying makes sense. I really do struggle with explaining things especially when frustrated. ",AmItheAsshole,Akari_92,0,0.41,16,2025-04-22 20:32:42+00:00,Asshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k5grdk/aitah_for_raising_my_voice_at_my_mother_for/,True,Asshole

My (F23) birthday is coming up in a couple of weeks and I haven’t done much planning behind it due to other personal things going on. My bf (M26) bday was back in March and I made sure it was as nice as could be seeing as how I was between jobs. He hasn’t asked me what I want to do for my birthday or what I want for my birthday. I text him today because I found out I had money saved up that I could still do my bday trip with (I originally planned to be OOT for my bday but it was sketchy bc of job situation) so I asked if he had planned anything and he said no. He then brought up that he was going out of town the week before and failed to tell me. When I asked him about it and told him he was selfish he made it seem like I was overreacting. I cancelled all my birthday plans and I plan on staying home now. AITA?

 TLDR: bf is going out of town the week before my birthday w/o telling me

Edit: We’ve been together almost 6 months and I am very vocal about how important birthdays are to me in general. For Christmas I got him thoughtful gifts that he asked for and he got me something I did not ask for or want. I told him for my birthday I wanted something special and surprising.

1k59jqz,AITA for bringing my own tea bag to a restaurant?,"AITA for bringing my own tea bag to a restaurant?

My mom and I went out to eat at a restaurant in Los Angeles. We sat down and ordered our food with no issues. We both asked for a cup of hot water and lemon, which was brought out with our entrees, again with no issues.

My mom and I happened to have bags of a specific healing tea, which I had brought with me due to a slight sore throat that day. (Note that it was a regular tea bag, not liquid or pre-prepared tea.) When the food and hot water arrived, we put our tea bags in the water and had the tea with our meal.

The waitstaff then began circling our table and staring at us throughout our meal. Then at the very end, one of the waitresses came over and said, ""Oh, you have tea?"" I said yes.

She said, ""You can't really do that.""

I said, ""It's a specific type of tea for my health.""

She said, ""It doesn't matter. We have tea here. Next time we'll have to charge you for the hot water.""

I said, ""You guys don't have this specific tea.""

She said, ""It doesn't matter. We'll have to charge you for hot water if you put your own special tea in the water.""

I said okay. I was surprised as I have never been to a place that charges for hot water.

The waitstaff continued to stare at us and started circling our table. Then, without asking if we were finished, the waitress brought the check to the table. I was planning on ordering a mango sticky rice, but didn't get the chance as she had brought the check.

Because of this experience, as we left, I did not leave a tip. I felt very unwelcome and awkward with the staring.

From my perspective, the hot water was free, and they had no other stated policy about bringing one's own tea, as they might with substitutions, splitting plates, etc. Also, even if they had that policy, the approach they took was hostile and unprofessional with the staring, circling, and preemptively bringing the check.

However, my friend is saying that I was in the wrong for bringing my own tea. She said I should never have brought the tea, despite my sore throat. And she says that if I did, I should have asked the waitstaff if I could use my own personal tea bag in hot water that they freely provided. She also says I stiffed the server for no good reason.

So, AITA for bringing my own tea to the restaurant?

Edit to note -- The not tipping did not have to do with the rule about the tea, which I accepted. I usually tip 20% minimum because I do know servers have it hard. 

I drew the line at the way the waitstaff began staring, circling our table, and hovering over us even after we had the tea discussion. They kept looking between us and the door. I found this to be hostile. In my opinion, enforcing a policy doesn't require that.

We are American and aware of tipping culture, and I believe we weren't treated professionally or like they wanted our business at all, i.e. bringing the check early.

1k52w71,AITA for eating my wife's Easter eggs?,"Please help me, Reddit, with adjudicating an Easter crime!

**The background:**

For Easter, my wife ordered us some little chocolate eggs. The box had about 20 eggs in different flavours.

**The day of the crime:**

By Sunday evening, we'd eaten most of the eggs and my wife showed me three eggs she wanted to keep for herself. I suggested she take them upstairs with her, but she said she didn't want to be tempted to eat them now, but wanted these particular flavours later. Okay, no problem, just put them somewhere safe. She puts them on the kitchen table near the rest of the box. Later that evening, I do some work on the kitchen table, notice her pile of three eggs is no longer there, and assume she moved/ate them. While I'm working I eat some eggs from the box. 

**The discovery of the crime:**

The next day, she's outraged that I ate her three eggs. I say I only ate ones from the box. It seems like somehow her eggs either made their way back into the box, or she lost them. I don't think I absent-mindedly took eggs from her pile because it was gone when I first looked, and would have been out of reach from where I was sitting anyway.

I apologised and have ordered her some new chocolate eggs, since it seems plausible I did eat the three she wanted. But she still hasn't dropped it and is not accepting my apology that it was an accident. I contend that leaving chocolate eggs around is silly and she should have put them away somewhere if they were that special to her.

1k4zjk6,AITA for leaving my friend after he threw up in the middle of nowhere?,"TW: This will mention throwing up quite a bit :)

2 weeks ago, one of my close friends (18M) and I (19M) decided that we'd go on 35 mile cycle (we are training to cycle to Paris) in a very hilly part of the Uk. Around this time, we did a 20 mile cycle together and found it fine, cycling at a decent pace. However, this friend then went to Florida for 2 weeks, and during this time, was unable to cycle much while I cycled almost daily and improved my speed and fitness. The day he returned, I checked if he would still be okay for the cycle, and he insisted that he still wanted to go.

We started the cycle at a fairly fast pace, but about 15 minutes in to the cycle, we went up a relatively steep but short rise in the road which I handled quite well. He was at the same pace as me for most of it but near the top, he really slowed down out of nowhere.

Once we reached the top, he asked to stop and he said that he was about to throw up. We waited a while as he retched once or twice. After I comforted him and asked if he wanted to turn back, he decided that he wanted to carry on. We did massively slow down the pace too and I told him that if he wanted to slow down further, he could.

We didn't really stop much after that until we started gaining altitude about 10 miles later. At this point, we were stopping every 5-10 minutes for him to catch his breath. I asked if he still wanted to carry on but he said he was too far away from home to know his way back so would just stick with me. We were less than a third of the way through at this point.

After climbing a pretty steep hill and descending again, we reached the steepest incline that we had seen so far. After about 2 minutes, he stopped, wobbled, and then started throwing up. He threw up multiple times and threw up quite a lot. I knew that he couldn't carry on so we walked up the hill to an empty driveway and sat down.

We checked and if we were to take public transport, it would take us 5+ hours to get home compared to the hour and a half long cycle back but he was in no position to cycle. So we decided to call his dad to pick him up but he said that he'd take an hour to reach us.

It suddenly got quite windy and cold and I was only wearing a t-shirt (as cycling would've kept me warm) so I asked if I could carry on with the cycle. I knew that the route would take me back to where he was and I guesstimated that I'd only be 45 mins to an hour. He said that was okay so I carried on, having a great time.

When I returned 50-ish minutes later, he was lying on the floor, watching TV on his phone and finishing his lunch. He said that he felt better but looked quite down. His dad then arrived soon after and picked him up and they left while I finished the cycle.

He hasn't spoken about it since. I feel bad for leaving a close friend of mine in the middle of nowhere on his own.

1k4y8ak,"AITA for cutting my hair (I'm 25f) after my mom, dad, and aunt (50s) told me not to?","I (25F) live with my parents after graduating college. I am financially dependent on them. I have a job, but it doesn't pay much. My dad is currently going through a stressful time with his job.

Lately I've been going through a depressive episode. Hoping to get out of it, I went to visit my college friends in Oregon. The trip went badly. I got my feelings hurt, also accidentally deleted all my iCloud Photos and I'm DEVASTATED, but those are topics for another post.

For some context about my hair - I got an awful layered bob in March 2024, and spent MONTHS crying and screaming to my parents about it.

My parents were there through every panic attack. They made me promise I would not cut my hair again until they say it's ok. But 1 year later, those ratty layers still bothered me.

Since I was in Oregon without my parents, I thought this would be the perfect time to get my hair done! I FaceTimed my mom (who is visiting my aunt in England right now). I don't see my aunt a lot since she lives in England, and she still calls me by childhood nickname - ""Elf-ears"", even though she knows it pisses me off.

""Elf-ears, don't do it!!"" they said over FaceTime. I told them ok I won't, but then changed my mind and did it anyway. In an expensive hair salon in Oregon that cost 1 month of my work, if that matters. I like my hair now, and feel much better about it.

But when my Mom, Dad, and Aunt found out over FaceTime that I cut my hair behind their back, they started saying things such as ""you broke your promise"" and ""you didn't stay true to your word"" and even went as far as to say ""you hurt the people who love you most"".

**Honestly, I didn't even know my hair was that important?? Why do they care so much? And I told them ""it's MY body, and I'm an adult.""**

My dad's response: ""What about all the times we stayed up with you for your panic attacks? It took a toll on us. What about OUR bodies?""

None of them are currently on speaking terms with me, and it only makes my depression and heartache  about losing my photos even worse. I am going through a very hard time.

1k4y6rq,AITA for inviting both of my boyfriend’s divorced parents to his college grad without telling him?,"I (26F) have been with my boyfriend (24M) for around 6 months. We seem to always be on the same page about everything. We’ve met each other’s families and everything went smoothly. His parents divorced when he was a child (fifth grade) but are both remarried and happy.

Weeks ago he invited me to his college convocation and graduation ceremony, and I said I’d be there. Each person receives two tickets, so it was going to be me and one other person. I asked who he’d like to bring and he immediately said he’d love to bring his parents but he couldn’t pick one, so he thought it was best that just him and I go. I agreed to his choice and was so excited.

Recently, we had dinner at his Mom’s and she was asking questions about his graduation. My bf lied, saying they only gave him one extra ticket and he’d already given it to me. His mom was visibly upset, and I felt guilty about the lie and the extra ticket he wasn’t giving to her. I have only been in the picture for 6 months and this was a huge event for him. I wanted his mom to be there. My bf has never mentioned much about his parents interactions now that they are divorced but this one action made me question: if they are both moved on and in happy relationships and seemingly on good terms… couldn’t they both go to the grad and be civil?

I spent the next few days thinking things over and ended up reaching out to my bfs mom without telling him. I explained the situation to her and asked if she would feel comfortable going to the celebration with her ex, and she LOVED this idea. I felt I was doing the right thing so I also asked his dad, who agreed. Honestly, I felt like he would love the surprise of both of his parents being there, but pulling off this scheme did not go over at all how I thought it would.

The grad happened a few days ago and I arranged for his parents to meet him at the front entrance by texting him that I’d arrived there, we were all in on it and I was so excited for them to be together during the event. Ten mins into the ceremony my phone began blowing up with texts from my bf, asking where I was and why I gave away my ticket. I replied that I thought it would be so awesome for both of his parents to be there.

He was fuming. He told me that he specifically did not want them here, and that he’d invited me. I felt heartbroken and apologized, but began to wonder if I am an asshole because I deceived him intentionally. He said I broke his trust, caused awkwardness, and made him upset because seeing them together made him devastated instead of happy. While I know my intentions were good, I believe he is being very sensitive about something that honestly could’ve been a sweet family moment. 

The last week he has been so cold to me despite my attempts to make things better. I feel bad for hurting him, but his parents said the event was great when I asked them, so I feel like this might be a him problem for being stuck on a divorce that happened in the fifth grade.",AmItheAsshole,Potential-Dirt-3672,0,0.28,79,2025-04-22 04:53:20+00:00,Asshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k4y6rq/aita_for_inviting_both_of_my_boyfriends_divorced/,True,Asshole
1k4xnl3,AITA for refusing to change our initial agreement?,"I've lived with my girlfriend for over two years. When we were talking about moving in together we agreed that as long as we could both comfortably afford 50% of the rent and bills then that's how we would split it things.

My girlfriend mentioned me paying more of the bills. I reminded her of our agreement but she just said it wasn't fair that I wasn't paying more. I disagreed and said there was nothing unfair about it. Me getting a payrise doesn't affect her ability to pay her half.

1k4ximk,WIBTA if I (24 F) prevented my friend (24 F) from attending a wedding,"My friend/roommate (24 F) has a boyfriend (25 M) who asked her to attend a wedding this summer. It's his sister's wedding, the venue is 3.5 hours away from us. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem, but there are scheduling conflicts with something she had planned over a year ago. She bought expensive, front seating tickets for a band she likes that's visiting the next state over, and planned on driving out to attend the concert on Friday. The issue is the wedding starts 11AM on saturday, and because she's dating the bride's brother, they wanted her to be at the venue at 8AM. 

Again, this normally wouldn't be a problem, but with the venue being 3.5 hours away, and her driving a state over to attend the concert (starts at 8PM), it's really putting a time crunch on her. The worst part is she's planning on working both before the concert and right after the wedding, packing even more into her schedule. As of right now, it's looking like:

10:00AM-4:00PM work
4:00PM-7:30PM drive to concert
8:00PM-11:00PM concert
11:00PM-1:30AM drive back
2:00AM-4:00AM sleep
4:30AM-8:00AM drive
8:00AM-11:00AM wedding prep
11:00AM-1:00PM wedding
1:00PM-4:30PM drive
4:30PM-8:00PM work

The 30 minute gaps are eating, getting ready, etc. I think it's absurd she's doing all of this, and getting only 2 hours of sleep while driving a cumulative 13 hours for 8 hours of draining social events. We think its insanely dangerous for her to be doing all of this. My other roommate and I came up with the idea of turning off her alarm for 4AM so she doesn't wake up and misses the wedding. We want to know if we would be the asshole from preventing her from going to the wedding

Other things influencing our decision are: she's an introvert going to alot of social events in a small period of time, she is not close with the sister, she does not want to go to the wedding, she's only attending because her bf's family is the type to hold grudges and she does not want to be scorned (which we think is petty and reason enough to not go), and she's actively trying to make more space between her and her bf (long story).

I am friends with Sam and John. We were all in a friendgroup as a group of three, (three never works out, for some reason), until Sam comes up to me and says that they need to talk to me. I talk to them in private and they told me that John had done something bad, and that they wouldn’t tell me until later. 

I was extremely worried because John is NEVER the type of person to do something bad on purpose, they’re a completely sweet and kind person. I am also extremely worried for Sam because they seemed extremely upset and worried, and refused to tell me what was going on.
I go to John and tell them I’m very worried about Sam, and ask them if anything major happened. John says they dont think anything happened, so I then tell them what had happened and John tells me that Sam had sent them texts saying ‘we need to talk.’ and such, never actually talking to them or telling them what was going on.
Sam figures out that I told John and is VERY upset. They send angry texts to me and still bring it up to this day (this happened a few weeks ago).
No, neither me, John, or anyone other than Sam and her best friend know the reasoning. They refuse to tell us constantly, and when it comes up they say stuff along the lines of ‘it’s just a bunch of stuff’ or ‘its complicated’. 


I want to know if I was okay to go to John and ask if they did anything. Sam still makes comments about it occasionally and it makes me feel sick to my stomach with guilt, but I dont know if I should feel guilty. AITA?

1k4rn59,AITA for leaving an honest review,"A friend has lived on rented property for decades. Her and her father had planted a tree together before his death, years ago. A couple weeks ago, she tearfully shared on Facebook that a tree company had unexpectedly pulled into her driveway, and taken out the healthy tree that her and her father had planted, along with the tree they were hired by the owner to remove. (Her tree was ""in the way"".) She said they were insulting, and threatening, yelling at her while she was crying hysterically, and threatening her with calling the police if she got in their way. 

I was appalled, and mentioned the incident in an online review of the company, not including any names or place specifics.

I tried to make the review somewhat funny (mentioning the Lorax) and stuck to the truth as it was told to me. I did not claim personal experience, but said it was a friend. (She's an older friend. I don't know how capable she would be of reviewing them, herself, plus she was so upset and scared. She seemed intimidated, but she tends to get that way.) 

She called me, today, saying her landlord and the tree company were there threatening her, claiming they were going to call the police, and have us both arrested. I tried to have a conversation, but they kept interrupting, screaming at me to take it down. It was during working hours, and got very stressful, so I caved, and took it down. I tried to tell them, but they couldn't hear me over their yelling, so I hung up. They called back twice. I let it go to voicemail the first time, hoping they'd cool off. I tried texting, but the phone number wouldn't accept a text. They left a long, rambling voicemail, then called, again. I answered, yelling back, ""I deleted it! Clear your cache!"" That was the only time I raised my voice. They were still screaming, so I blocked them. 

This is not the first time her drama has interrupted my work. My son said he recorded the call. I had them on speaker, and he could hear it in the next room. He said their threats were baseless. I fear for her health, but now feel there's nothing I can do. AITA for leaving an honest review, hoping the company might improve customer service? I didn't know if the higher ups knew what had happened in the field. Am I the asshole for hanging up, and blocking my now ex-friend? I've been leaving honest reviews for decades, and have never had anyone scream at me, let alone threaten me. Some companies have offered support when I've been disappointed. I have acknowledged their efforts, and improved my rating. I felt progress was made, and communication facilitated through previous reviews, but this experience has left me feeling those days are gone.",AmItheAsshole,dianamomma,0,0.39,25,2025-04-21 23:15:34+00:00,Asshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k4rn59/aita_for_leaving_an_honest_review/,True,Asshole
1k4o74e,AITA because I asked my MIL about her finances?,"Final Update: Thanks so much for your input, Everyone.  It sounds like I am TA.  I've learned that I can come from a place of love and good intention and still end up being TA.



My husband and I are considering an investment in a piece of property that would use up almost all of our savings.  Before we move forward with that investment I thought it would be a good idea to check in with our parents (retired & in their 70s) to see if they forsee any need for financial assistance from us.    About half my friends help support their parents so it doesn't seem out of the realm and I feel like it's the responsible thing to do to have this discussion with our parents because 1) we care about them and would want to help them if needed; and 2) if they did forsee a need for help, we would rather invest in something that we could liquidate. 

My brother handles my dad's finances so I asked him.  He reported that my dad should be fine.  End of conversation.

I asked my MIL if we could discuss finances and she was DEEPLY offended.  I explained that we were not asking for details of her finances, but only if she could forsee any need for financial help in the future.  She said ""No. I've always considered my money over here, your money over there, and never the two shall meet."" She was obviously angry by the tone of her response.  I tried to lighten the mood and end the already uncomfortable conversation by saying ""Ok; I just hope that if there's ever an emergency, you know you could come to us, like I hope we could come to you."". The look on her face told me that we were NOT welcome to come to her in an emergency.

So... AITA here?

Updates to clarify a few things:

1) my husband was also present for the conversation and agreed that it was an important discussion to have with our parents.

2) I have had a good relationship with my MIL for almost 20 years.

3) I truly wasn't trying to hint that we wanted her to be our backup in case our investment didn't work out.  

4) my MIL was a single mother who raised 2 kids alone.  She often worked 2 jobs just to support her family.  So we have no idea what her financial situation is.

5) our question for her came from a place of love and was intended to be a conversation to let her know that we love her and want to be there for her if she ever needs help. 

6) My comment about ""...just like we would hope that you would be there for us"" was my awkward way of ending the conversation. I was SO uncomfortable at that point that the words came out of my mouth before I could stop them. 

7) we never mentioned our investment to her.  We simply told her we were planning for our financial future and wanted to know if she forsaw any financial need in the future.

1k4g4cr,AITA for saying that school buses are not gangster?,"So my IRL friend is one of those people who are school bus enthusiasts or something. I don't have a problem with that, but he got into a group online full of people who act like those wannabe gangsters online. They play some ROBLOX knockoff called ""Rigs of rods"" and drive online school buses or something. I don't pay attention to that as it's not my buisness.

The issue started a few weeks ago when I found his TikTok when one of his videos came up on my fyp. I didn't know this but he makes videos of school buses turning and puts loud ass music over them and says that it's ""WHIPPING"" or some other weird ass slang. Yes, I'm dead serious. This is the content he spends his time making. Edits out of school buses with gangster rap over them. If you think it's ridiculous, I agree with you. I knew he recorded his rides on school buses, but I didn't know he used them to make gangster whipping edits out of them. (look these up on tiktok if you need more context on the type of stuff he makes)

On Thursday when we were on the bus home I asked him what he was using the videos he records for. He said that he just uses it for inspiration on what to make online, so I showed him his tiktok and told him that school buses are not gangster. He called me a dick for putting his tiktok out and told me that he needs to ""make the haters online jealous"". I told him that nobody is jealous of our bus driver who goes 25 in a 40. He stopped talking for the rest of the ride and hasn't talked to me since. I know this sounds so ridiculous and I still can't believe that people actually watch his content, but AITA for saying that school buses are not gangster?

1k4g147,AITA for canceling as a friends plus one 5 days before a wedding?,"To give a bit of context, I have been sick for the last 2 1/2 weeks. Over the past weekend I had a stomach bug which kept me out of commission all weekend. The wedding is this upcoming weekend and it would be staying Friday, Saturday (wedding day) and coming back home Sunday morning/afternoon (about a 3 hour drive one way from where I live). I was invited by my friend as her plus one to a wedding of a friend of hers. The reason that I cancelled is because I have been really sick lately and just burned out from work. And the thought of having to spend a weekend with my friend’s other friends, was giving me a lot of anxiety. When I was originally asked to be a plus one I thought it would just be me and my friend spending the time together, but one of her friends on the trip I’m not entirely comfortable with being around. He is married and even though whenever he’s around he’s always with his wife, he is always staring at me. It makes me uncomfortable and the thought of staying under the same roof as him for an entire weekend seems like a bit much. 
My most recent therapy session my therapist said that my body is physically showing signs that I need to rest. And that I needed to stop always adding things to my to do list. I feel like I’m making a decision to prioritize both my physical and mental health. But because it is such short notice, should I just stick it out and make good on my commitment to my friend and be her plus one?

1k4fdiv,AITA for telling my adult boyfriend it’s weird for his mom to host an Easter egg hunt?,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for three years. I am 34 years old and he is 28. His mother can be a bit clingy and she’s always referring to my boyfriend and his sister, who is 30 years old, as “the kids”. His sister still lives with his mom and doesn’t pay a dime in rent or contribute to household chores. The way their mother interacts with them is much like a parent and young child dynamic. They are also full adults and are also at fault in this situation. There’s no reason they should expect their mother to cover the bill when they eat at Chili’s or provide his sister with housing and cover all expenses. I’ve always thought it was bizarre- I have a very adult life, I’ve built a career and have my sights set on purchasing a house and having children. My relationship with my mother is very different- we go for walks and meet for cocktails. When we eat I either pay for half the bill or offer to pay because I make more money than my mother. Anyways, things kinda blew up because my boyfriend celebrated Easter with his family (I wasn’t there I visited my brother and sister in law) and I learned his mother had set up an Easter egg hunt with candy for him and his sister. There were no children at this event it was just full blown adults looking for hidden plastic eggs with candy. I freaked out and told him that was weird and really age inappropriate. Enjoying holidays and giving your adult children Easter baskets is cute and festive, but hosting an Easter egg hung is embarrassing. I’m hoping she doesn’t post pictures of her adult children on a candy scavenger hunt on social media. She needs to engage with her children as adults, how are they supposed to relate to her or ask for life advice when she’s treating them like they’re in element school. They’re missing out on an important change from adolescences into adulthood and I think it’s affecting their identity. AITA? 

UPDATE: OK so it looks like I need to expand on a few things here- I still may be TA even with this extra context, but I can definitely see why I come across as judgmental or as someone said a ""Fun-sucker"" lol. First off-whoever is suggesting we break up-that's not on the table at this time. I love my BF more than any relationship I've ever had and we're very compatible. He is warm and even thought I think its weird he does an easter egg hunt, I think it's sweet he entertains his moms effort into hosting a fun activity. Even from the beginning of our relationship my BFs mom has been really clingy with her son. My BF has always lived with his mother and never paid a single bill or put food in the fridge. After 8 months I proposed we should move in together and his mother vehemently opposed this idea. She told him not to do it and that he would regret it when we broke up and he would be in a bad situation. I didn't understand- I had a stable job and a high salary, I was very responsible and maintained healthy relationship qualities. She should be happy for us. Luckily he moved in with me and we're happy living together- despite this she continues to call him frequently asking him to come home to see her. She lives almost two hours and pretty much every single weekend my boyfriend travels down to his childhood home to see her. If he says he's not coming up she gets visibly sad. We've gone on a couple vacations together and she suggests very childlike activities. I'm not really a Disney person and neither is my boyfriend but she continues to suggest age inappropriate activities and sometimes we feel like we're being strung along. It's not really the ""fun activities"" that get me frustrated, I do fun things like occasionally go to a bar-cade or play video games, I had a dinner party with some girlfriends and we played pin the tail on the Donkey because it's my favorite animal, I love interactive games like trivia and board games. I just think this is indicative of a larger issue, I want my BF to feel comfortable having adult conversations with his mother like how I want children and he's unsure, or how to budget his money effectively or big life decisions. I'm worried she's going to want to keep him eternally a child and not support his big life's milestones or even just have the conversations with him.

Also for everyone concerned if I had a shitty childhood- I did all the fun children's' activities when I was very young but I grew up in a dysfunctional household and was in foster care for the remainder of my youth. When I was 18 I signed myself out of foster care and had to work very, very hard taking on an labor jobs with low wages I could to survive. I did this for a long time until I achieved security without any familial support. I don't expect my BF to be as rock sold as I am because I was forced into independence out necessity to meet my basic needs. It was really really hard and I wouldn't want him to experience that.",AmItheAsshole,Heart_Trap,0,0.27,154,2025-04-21 14:48:43+00:00,Asshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k4fdiv/aita_for_telling_my_adult_boyfriend_its_weird_for/,True,Asshole
1k4egwo,WIBTA for calling animal services on our aunt?,"Hi everyone, so my little sister (female, 18) and me (enby, 24) are currently unsure about what to do in situation regarding our aunt. She lives in a rural area in the midst of a forest, a lot of wildlife lives there and since a couple of months, there has been a wild cat living close by her house.  Currently, the cat has one older litter of kittens (3 kittens) and a new litter with one kitten. Besides the youngest kitten, all of the others are feral and only tolerate my aunt. 

The problem is the following: it is an unneutered female cat and so are her kittens. My aunt refuses to get any of them neutered. My mother has tried talking to her, but she doesn’t want to rock the boat any further and just accepts the situation as it is. Other family relatives have talked to her about it and chewed her out on the consequences of having so many feral cats around and not neutering them … but my aunt doesn’t really listen. She is rather … eccentric, regarding many things, but she isn’t a terrible person. She takes good care of them, feeds them regularly and tries to introduce them to other people. 

My little sister and I have trouble accepting the situation as it is, because on the one hand we are of course concerned for the cats as we do not want them to suffer through giving birth over and over again, all the health risks involved with unneutered cats and also because the neighborhood is not safe for kittens as there is a dog very close by who already has been a danger to the older kittens. On the other hand we are also concerned for our aunt as she isn’t the youngest anymore and we are unsure if she is capable of caring for so many cats later on. 

That’s the reason why we were thinking about just calling animal services right away on our aunt anonymously and helping these cats as discussions have not been fruitful at all so far. 

On the other hand we are both unsure if that is the wisest thing to do – because where we are living (not UK, not USA), animal services tend to take the cats with them and do not release them back into the wild and instead try to find a home for them … or give them to a shelter. Which I do not think is that wise for feral cats. Also I wonder if we shouldn’t at least try and talk to our aunt before doing something so drastic and getting her into trouble like that. 

Can someone give us advice on this? We are thinking of convincing arguments, but maybe someone out there in the internet has that one genius killer argument that might actually do it and help us convince her before starting so much drama …

1k4aw0r,AITA for shit-talking my friend behind his back?,"I know I've posted a lot on here before, but there's a lot of things going on, and this is one of the biggest ones.

I, 16M, am in a group of friends with 3 other kids: (for the sake of discretion, I won't reveal their real names), River (16F), Victor (16M) and Simon (18M).

The issue at hand is with Simon. For a little bit of context, I live right down the street from Simon, in the so-called 'rich kid neighborhood'. The housing development has a lot of upper class families living in it, so I suppose it makes sense.

While me and Simon live in the upper class neighborhood, River and Victor live close to one another in a different neighborhood. The difference in our finances has never been a problem with me, River or Victor, but lately, Simon has been a bit insensitive about this fact.

Our high school prom is coming up very soon, and the other day, we were all on a voice call discussing what we wanted to do for the night, dinner plans, all that jazz. Simon suggested we all go to this Japanese hibachi place, but everyone else, including me, thought against it, because it's a restaurant we've ALWAYS gone to as a group, and we wanted to try something different.

I suggested another restaurant that had a bunch of options for cheese and chocolate fondue that my family went to a few months prior. Everyone agreed that sounded pretty good, and Victor started looking at the menu and pricing. I gave them a warning that it was a bit on the expensive side, and if the price was a bit too much, we could always look for another place.

Simon decides this is the perfect moment to jump in with, and I quote, ""Yeah, since we're all in... different financial situations, maybe another restaurant would be better.""

The call got REAL quiet after that, and I could tell everyone, including me, was shocked. I knew Simon wasn't shy about flaunting money, but to say something like that?

What really ticks me off about this situation is that Simon brags about money that isn't his. He's almost in college, and he's never had a job. Not a cent of the money he spends is his own. River and myself both have jobs, so we have money we can call our own, and I know Victor is trying to get a job as well.

Anyways, this is where I could be the asshole. Me, River and Victor have been talking about Simon behind his back, and how we're fed up with him always throwing around money that technically isn't even his. Simon's been hounding on us about prom, saying since this is his last prom, it should be 'special'.

I'm considering calling off prom altogether, considering this issue, but I do feel I could be the asshole for unintentionally rallying the rest of the friend group against Simon behind his back.

1k48ve7,AITA for not picking a side?,"So my bf (who I'll call Jake) and mother (who I'll call Anna) got into a fight. Me and Jake recently moved in together. His parents helped us with the move, and my parents are helping us with our yard. So my parents and Jake were both here while I had work. 
When I came home I sensed something was wrong. Turns out Anna was commanding how every should be done, and that it only should be done in that specific way. Clearly Jake disliked that and tried to brush it off. When I got home from work, they weren't being neutral, but both slightly annoyed. I tried to talk to both of them and they both didn't really bother listening to me. 
After a long day of work I make my usual coffee and got back out. I see Anna barging out of the yard, preparing to drive off, packing everything up. While I was in the house, my dad and Jake were putting the fence up and Anna kept interfering. 
Eventually Jake yelled at Anna saying she shouldn't command him in his own house and that he's had enough of her interfering. 

This week I've been bombarded by my mom to  end things with my bf as this is the third time they got in a 'fight'. Not many words were said though. 
Even my father feels like I should think twice about my relationship. 
I know my boyfriend feels sorry and knows he shouldn't have acted that way, he wanted to apologise so he sent her a message. My mom doesn't even wanna see him anymore and won't come visit our house either. 

I'm in between the two and im not picking my mom's side or his side. She just tries to manipulate people to make me pick her side and it's stressing me out. On the other hand my bf did something he shouldn't have which he regrets. I feel like they both got hurt and should make up, as this seems really childish to me. I just really want to breathe, everyone around me is just giving their opinion and I'm fed up with all of it. I can't seem to be support both of them either, as I just really want them to solve it and not have me in the middle of it. 

To me it seems like a minor fight that could be easily solved. But my mom has a tendency of being overly dramatic, though she has a golden heart and really wanted to help us. My boyfriend on the other hand has been stressed out by moving in together.

1k47xhc,AITA for arguing with my dad over his job,"So I (18F) recently got in contact with my father about six months ago after having no contact my whole life. I've started spending a lot of time with him, and our relationship is quite close, but I strongly disagree with one of his main sources of income. I live in the UK, where cannabis is not legal, but it's super normalized. Both my father and I partake (I don’t condone it, and I do have a medical card for migraines), but my father told me when I first met him that he “sorts his mates out,” which I assumed was on a small scale, and I felt I wasn’t in a position to judge. However, the more time I spend at his house, the more I see it isn’t small scale; he has a lot of people come around to pick up (when I’m there, it can be 3-6 people an evening, each spending a fair amount of money).

This has started to bother me, and I’ve been trying to bring it up without offending him, as a lot of the money he earns goes towards me (he often pays for my groceries, bought me a car, and gives me lots of other gifts). He also works in a warehouse but not very often. I tried to mention that it’s hard for me to have a father who isn’t your stereotypical 9-5 working person, but when I brought it up, he got upset and made me feel bad by reminding me how much he does for me and that he’s trying to make up for the 17 years he wasn’t there.

I kind of wish I could address this and maybe come to a compromise, like especially not having people come around while I’m there.

1k45b28,AITA -Partner smoking habits bother me more than they probably should.,"I (23M) have been with my girlfriend (22F) for three years. We both come from amazing families, but we were raised very differently. I was brought up believing that smoking is bad and should be avoided. She, on the other hand, was raised in a household where it was normalized—she even smokes with her parents.

Personally, I’m not completely against it. I’ll partake maybe 3-4 times a year, but that’s it.

Back in college, it bothered me, but I brushed it off—figured it was just part of the college experience. Still, I never liked how much her personality would change when she smoked. That was a big reason it didn’t sit right with me.

Now that we’re getting more serious, I’ve started thinking about the long-term implications—like how this might impact raising kids, our lifestyle, and our values as a couple. Everytime I bring it up she feels like I’m attacking her and not respecting her choices.

1k44lv3,AITA Should I be doing the housework and paying all of the bills?,"My SO works I do not. However, I pay all of the bills. He contributes some sometimes but not half of the actual cost.

1k6b9m8,AITA for Telling my wife she was overreacting,"One afternoon I took my kids bike riding and when we came home I asked my wife to open the garage door so i could put the bikes back.  I walked them to the back and put them in our garage and then returned to the front door of the house.  Kids wanted a snack, so I helped prepare it.  About 5 minutes later I think the check the garage door and see it is still opened.  We live in an area where people tend to get things stolen if they leave their garages open.  I look into the garage and I don't see my wife--she does tend to like to do yard work so it can be common that she would be outside doing something.  I ask the kids if they know where their mom is--they say they think she is upstairs, so I close the garage door.  Not a minute later she is calling my phone--she was still outside.  She sounds a little angry.  She is ripping off blames left and right on the phone about how she told the kids specifically to tell me not to close the door.  I end up having to interrupt her because shes sort of going on a tirade--I just want to know if she needs me to reopen the garage door or not.  She says she doesn't, as she can actually open it on her phone.  She gets back inside and questions/criticizes the kids.  Note our kids are all 10 or younger.  She even inserts some blame about how they are always thinking about wanting to play videogames and not listening.  After the kids leave the room I speak and tell her she shouldn't say that, that the kids were at the table snacking and video games weren't part of the equation, that she is overreacting over this--yes maybe the kids didn't hear her correctly--perhaps it was a miscommunication and they misunderstood, in the end we were all inside and she was not actually locked out.  

  
She stewed for the rest of the entire day and then part of the next, so the next night I asked her what was wrong and she brought up the garage incident again.  She said she was more mad that I accused her of overreacting than the incident itself, yet she still found additional ways to blame me or make me feel bad, such as why couldn't i have called her before closing the door, or could I not have noticed that her shoes weren't there and figured out she was outside.  I agreed that I could have, but I didn't--yes we made a mistake a closed the door on her, I just didn't agree that it was such a big deal, and I specifically did not agree with her making a big fuss on the kids about it.  

  
Am i an asshole for telling her shes overreacting?  Should I have just taken the L on this one and let her tirade on us all for being bad listeners and bad communicators?

Edit : I realize I left out some critical background on this. My wife and I already go to counseling. I have suspected she could have a form of ocd ocpd and there is a history of from my perspective anger and control issues. I recognize that it is not entirely on her though and am trying to reflect on the things that I do that contribute to her stresses.  But I feel like there are certain things that just go beyond acceptable and I call them out when they happen.

That’s when I got close to a guy, let’s call him P. We bonded over preparing for a competitive exam (India), and even had the same exam center. On the way there, he wouldn’t stop talking, and it was frustrating—especially since it was a big day. My dad, in our native language (which P doesn’t understand), started swearing at him to keep quiet and focus. That car ride messed with both our focus. I missed the cutoff by a few marks, and P didn’t clear it either.

When we got home, my dad told me P was a distraction and a leech. But I ignored it. Later, I got into my dream school and he didn’t. He started whining about how a “superior” student like him didn’t get in, but I did. I let it slide—it sounded like something said in the heat of the moment.

I even helped him apply to a school in Delhi. I literally helped him build his whole application. He ended up getting a scholarship thanks to me too. (I had reached the final round of a competition and pulled some strings with the organizers to get our friend group in, including him. He used MY work  everything from the ppt to the final word doc in the application and landed the scholarship.)

Fast forward, I got a 100% scholarship to another college by the same founders. P downplayed it, saying they were “handing them out like candy” and that it wasn’t real. Again, I brushed it off. That’s just how he was sometimes.

Then college started. He ghosted our whole friend group and left all our WhatsApp groups. He even blocked me on Instagram. I thought, maybe he’s just moving on. But then I heard he came back to town a few times and met up with everyone—except me.

Then I had a near-death accident. My therapist encouraged me to reconnect with people important to me. So, I reached out to him. He said he felt like I always blamed him, that I pushed him around, and that he chose his peace. It felt like betrayal.

I lashed out. I said he was just a replacement for my old friend group, called him arrogant, ungrateful, and reminded him I helped him get that scholarship. I said he never checked up on me when I was hospitalized, and that he distracted me at a major turning point in my life.

He told me I was ego-driven, always seeking attention, and that he didn’t owe me any explanation. He “chose peace” and ended the friendship.

My friends and girlfriend say I should move on—that he’s not worth it. But he used to be a good friend before college. I still miss who he was, and a part of me wants him back in my life.

So… AITA for lashing out at him? Should I try to fix things or just let go?",AmItheAsshole,ammmmmmmmdaaaaaaa,0,0.43,11,2025-04-23 19:39:51+00:00,Everyone Sucks,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k68atw/aita_for_getting_my_friend_a_scholarship_in_his/,True,Everyone Sucks
1k5umj6,WIBTA for not Attending a Wedding where my wife was excluded from the bachelorette party?,"WIBTA? Wife is excluded from Bachelorette Party, I'm planning on skipping wedding and telling off the in-laws

Honestly, my wife (and I) are almost always excluded from family activities or outings in one way or another.
My wife is literally the sweetest woman on Earth, (puts up with me), and has always been incredibly kind and patient as long as I've known her.
We flew into town from out of state for her brothers wedding this Friday. Last night we had over her soon-to-be SIL, all of her siblings that were able to make it, and her other brother's fiancee. That other fiancee and her two sisters were talking about going to Target tomorrow... To buy the new SIL a gift for her bachelorette party on Thursday. We were shocked. We came from out of state, and assumed since we hadn't heard anything that she had already had it before we got there, (which would have been fine and understandable,) but now it turns out that my wife, his oldest sister, wasn't invited, but the other two sisters, (one 26F and the other 17F), AS WELL as the other brother's fiancee, are all going.

Not a WORD has been said to my wife about her being invited. When it got brought up, the two sisters acted like they got caught or something, didn't offer any consoling words, and changed the subject to my wife's health and how her kidneys are getting worse. 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️

So, what do you think? Am I overreacting to not go to the wedding after all, tell off my in-law for being jerks to my wife her whole life, and possibly stop coming to family events?",AmItheAsshole,Due-Guarantee103,590,0.8,368,2025-04-23 09:08:16+00:00,Everyone Sucks,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k5umj6/wibta_for_not_attending_a_wedding_where_my_wife/,True,Everyone Sucks
1k5ima4,WIBTA if I took my moms dog while she’s in rehab and didn’t give him back,"Context: I (31F) am 100% no contact with my mom (50F). She’s narcissistic, abusive emotionally, verbally and formerly physically. I tried low contact, I tried to “mend fences” but a whole childhood of abuse from her to me, and lying about her use of scripts finally took its toll a little over a year ago. Everything is transactional with her, and it’s completely exhausting. I’ve paid her bills, I’ve given her a car that she wrecked because she was high, and for months and months I drove her everywhere. My final straw was when I worked a 9 hour day; picked my four kids up, then had to drive her around for five hours for errands - hadn’t even fed my kids dinner yet - and she bitched me out for not stopping so she could buy Mexican food. While she was high. I refused to stop because I knew by the next week she’d be begging me for money. I ripped her a new one all the way to her house, apologized to her husband (33M) for what I was leaving him with, and haven’t seen her since. Full blockage, him and her. 
Well, she recently called the police on her husband and accused him of beating on her. From what I understand, they let him go when he was able to prove that she fell while high. So he’s gone. She is completely alone with her 2 dogs, a pitbull and a mastiff that WAS MINE but she never gave back after I had my daughter in 2019 when she dogsat. He was well taken care of, loved, and spoiled so I didn’t fight too hard. I still saw him regularly, until this past year. I’ve been trying to get him back without having to deal with her and hadn’t really found a way. Wellllll, long story short, because she kicked her husband out the way he did and he isn’t coming back, she’s gone off the deep end according to my brother and has started mixing her pills again and been a danger to herself. He’s trying to have her committed/sent to rehab - I’m not entirely sure and to be frank, I do not care. What I DO care about is my dog. The pitbull has bit my child twice so I refuse to deal with her, my brother can find someone else or she can be put down if the shelter won’t take her. I know that’s callous, and it’s not the breed I have a problem with it’s THAT PARTICULAR DOG. But there’s NO ONE around here who are family or friends, not even my brother he’s 700 miles away. Just me. But for “my” dog, the mastiff, I want to take him back and I wouldn’t give him back when she’s released. She’s unstable (rehab and mental health help will only last a month at best in my experience), has an unstable living environment (eviction pending), and has no money for the vet care that he’s going to need as he ages. I’m pretty sure the last time he saw a vet was when I took him in 2019. Meanwhile, my husband and I both have full time jobs that pay fairly well, we own our home and a yard, and have a vet we know and love. WIBTA if she does end up “away” that I take him back and not give him to her when she’s released? Would it be wrong to upheave his life like that? 


To clarify- I have been asked to take care of both dogs at her home. That would entail driving an hour each direction 3x a day. I am unwilling and unable to do that. I would take the mastiff to my home, and my brother would need to find alternate arrangements for the pitbull until her release.

1k5ejec,AITA for saying her cats shouldn’t have full access to the house?,"I'm in the process of buying a house with my fianceé, but I'm traumatized as to how unwholesome her fuzz riddled home is (1 bedroom apt and 2 cats). 

**The thing is, I'm allergic. I'm severely allergic to cats.** I have to take an allegra every time I go to her place, otherwise my face gets swollen, my eyes gets watery, and I get an unbearable amount of sneezing. Whenever I sleep there, the cats will walk on my face during the night and I'll wake up to a miserable next day. 

**She knew that, we were together for years, and still she adopted a cat.** Back then she put me against the wall, talking about how much she always wanted one, how lonely she was during the week, and ended up nudging me to accept it. After a while, on a whim, she got the 2nd one without even talking to me first. I didn't love the idea, we fought, but in the end I wasn't about to end a healthy relationship because of a cat, so I tried to bear with it. Now we're talking about marriage and we're on the process of buying a home, but I don't wanna live the rest of my life on daily allergy medication, with terrible breathing and overall welfare. 

At first I proposed the cats to be strictly outdoors. We could put safety nets around the property perimeter and let them live outdoors with my dog. She DID NOT agree. I folded, and further proposed the cats to be restricted only to the ground floor, not being allowed upstairs to the bedrooms. This is where we're at now, and again, she does not agree.

***The cats must have access to the whole house, and if they like, they'll sleep with us.*** 

Accordingly to her, ""her cats are her companions"", ""they always slept with her"", ""I AGREED WITH HER GETTING CATS BACK THEN"" (?) (she guilt-tripped me into agreeing with one, back then). 

Now I'm feeling pretty f\_cking miserable over considering breaking up a marriage over a f\_cking cat. I'd love not having this medical condition, but it's beyond my control. I'm not about to rationally choose to live a miserable life in a furpocalypse, sleeping in a shedquarters, never again owning a proper black pair of pants because she gaslit me into accepting them.

1k5dgks,AITA for calling my MIL a narcissist?,"To start: I never told my MIL this to her face. 

My husband and I were having a discussion about how hurt I was from the externally hurtful comments his mother made to me during our wedding. When I stated, “She’s ✨acting like✨ a narcissist“.

Very recently, I was speaking with MIL on the phone, when out of the blue she listed off reasons why she no longer speaks to me. One of them, “You called me a narcissist!” 
(I knew right there and then, that my husband told her of what we talked about in confidence)

MIL went on, to explain that she had all of these plans put in place for when I would come and visit… but now that she has learned this, she has canceled everything. 

Even to go on and strongly suggest we get a divorce.

1k5dfed,WIBTA for getting an anti-bark device for my neighbors dogs?,"I(27f) moved into my house about 5 months ago. My neighbor(60ish f) has 3 small dogs that bark constantly. If they see me in my living room, they bark. Anything interesting in the yard - bark. Want in? - bark. If I am working in the yard, they come out and bark at me, doing it on and off for the duration of me using my yard. I'm sure if I had people over outside, they would never shut up. It's annoying and defining. 

I haven't had a conversation with her about it, but she seems to let them bark at her constantly and the classic doesn't bother to train a small dog. I'm doubtful a conversation would go anywhere, but you never know. 

Here is the alternative I have been contemplating... They make anti bark devices that sense barking and will emit a high pitch noise that dogs hate. I could buy one of these and position it at her yard. The reason to not have a conversation before getting one of these is I think she would be less likely to suspect it when her dogs start acting funny. Also, I think it's common sense to not let your dogs bark at someone in their own backyard, so not sure what a conversation will do... But you know what they say about common sense. 

So what do you think - would I be the asshole for getting one of these devices And using it on my neighbor's yard without trying to have a conversation first? 

Edit: the noise is ultrasonic, so only dogs can hear it, not humans. They are somewhat commonly used for dog training, and do not add noise to the neighborhood. Also, I fixed a couple minor typos above.

1k5bzk1,AITA For bringing food to my friend's party?,"Right so I've got this friend I'll call Steve who is a great friend but not a great host in some aspects. He throws parties which are fun and enjoyable save for one problem that arises literally every time. There is never enough food.

For example, he had a game night and there were 10 people other than him and his wife there. He ordered 2 large pizzas and one small specialty pizza (this was from Dominos if you're curious about the size). For sides there was an order of garlic knots or something like that. So the party was fun, but after a couple hours I was hungry again/still and overheard another couple talking about getting food on their way home.

The next time there was a get together I offered to have me and my wife bring a dish, but he insisted he had food covered. We show up and again, there's only enough for everyone to have one serving of the pasta he made. It really wasn't enough.

I don't think it's a matter of cheapness, because the problem is only for food not for drinks, he happily shares his extensive liquor cabinet and always buys plenty of beer and wine. He also always happily brings dishes for potlucks at other houses.

For the next get together at his house I pitched the idea of a potluck, some other friends also signed on to the idea. I'm sure you can see where this is going. Then New Years Eve he hosted and we ran out of snacks before midnight and a couple of people ended up dipping to go to another party. He seemed annoyed but I don't think he made the connection.

So finally last weekend he was hosting again and rather than ask, I decided I would just bring a dish and some snacks. He was visibly annoyed but didn't say anything about it, he was just short and avoided me for most of the evening. The next day he texted me saying it was rude to bring food to someone else's house like that. I apologized and said I was just trying to be helpful and reminded him about how food had run out at previous get togethers and I was just trying to help avoid that. He got mad and accused me of saying he's a bad host. I told him I didn't think that was true at all, just that his food estimation abilities needed some work and that leftovers aren't a bad thing.

He didn't respond and hasn't responded to any of my messages since.",AmItheAsshole,BellPerfect1504,1627,0.96,282,2025-04-22 17:22:20+00:00,Everyone Sucks,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k5bzk1/aita_for_bringing_food_to_my_friends_party/,True,Everyone Sucks

1k4io6n,WIBTA for telling my fiancés parents his financial crisis?,"I (29 F) am going to marry my fiancé (31 M) in 2 months.  We have been together for 5 years and I wouldn’t trade it for the world.  Recently our landlord mentioned that we will need to move at the end of our lease as they are going to be upgrading our unit.  Unfortunately, the end of our lease is 2 weeks after our wedding. I’m panicking as our wedding is coming up AND we have to move AND my fiancé will be in the middle of a career change. This is the most stressful and exciting time of our lives. We applied to our dream apartment, in a safe neighborhood with laundry in-unit and a balcony.  We currently live in not the safest neighborhood, our mail is stolen frequently, our laundry is 4 floors down without an elevator, and our kitchen is barely even a kitchen, so for 5 years I have been dreaming of living somewhere new, somewhere where we feel like we’ve leveled up in the world.  Well, it came to my attention that my fiancé has a terrible credit score and we got denied our dream apartment. I was and still am furious as my fiancé doesn’t understand how credit works. (I never asked him his credit as I figured he was doing well and we are adults, I didn’t think I would have to teach my fiancé about credit.) 

Because of his bad credit, we cannot find a place that will accept his credit which means I have no idea if we’re going to have a roof over our head after we get married.  My credit is strong but without his income I do not make 3x the amount of rent each month and hence, we can’t live in the area that we had been dreaming of.  

Our options are to find a cheap place in an area that we don’t want to be living in for another year while I patiently wait for his credit to build, or would I be the asshole if I went to his parents and asked them to put his name on one of their credit cards to increase his credit and help us solidify a place to live sooner rather than later.

My fiancé has a strong relationship with his parents and I realize that if I say something to his parents, he’ll feel less than and embarrassed about his situation.  

The only debt we have are school loans which is only a few thousand. Our cars are paid off, we don’t have any credit card debt.  So money is not an issue for us, he just has poor credit.  So WIBTA going to his parents for some guidance and help? I’m beyond stressed out, I haven’t been able to sleep and I need help asap. 


**edit**
Sorry I left out crucial information. We have both discussed in length about how he got into the position that he’s in.  He understands what he did to get himself in this situation and I can empathize. Yes, I absolutely learned valuable lessons myself and we both call moments like these AFGO moments (another f***ing growth opportunity). I asked him about talking to his parents so this would not be me going behind his back at all.  He would like to think about it for himself first, I just wanted to hear what others might think or have for advice?  

We BOTH learned valuable lessons and are going to be learning from them.  ",AmItheAsshole,Euphoric-Pass2727,41,0.83,99,2025-04-21 17:07:29+00:00,Everyone Sucks,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k4io6n/wibta_for_telling_my_fiancés_parents_his/,True,Everyone Sucks
1k4bay3,AITA for swearing at my sister's boyfriend after he falsely accused me of stealing?,"I (30m) recently moved out of my dad's house into my own apartment with my friend. My dad still lives with my brother, sister, and her boyfriend (38m) of 5 years. I moved out amicably over a variety of reasons.

I've been back to my dad's once every week to visit. This has gone pretty well – my sister and her boyfriend work third shift. It's mostly been visiting my dad and my brother. Everything was fine until last Friday.

My sister's boyfriend randomly asked me if I took any silverware. My dad has been to my place and is aware I have my own. After I say no, he says the silverware's disappeared recently, and I say I didn't take it. He then says, “Well the only variables are half the silverware's gone and you moved out.”

I exploded. My sister's boyfriend said something to the effect of “I'm just asking questions, I'm not accusing you of anything”, which didn't stop me. In my mind, after he said what he said, it turned into an accusation and a press. I said that if he really was asking questions he would've dropped it after my first no. He then went off about how someone must have thrown it out, and I pressed him about the accusation.

My dad stepped in, explained that I was innocent, and separated us. Eventually, our screaming woke my sister up and she yelled at us to be quiet. I explained the situation and she yelled at him. Every time he tried to defend or explain himself, I yelled back, which devolved into my sister yelling at us to “shut the fuck up so she can get some sleep before work”. My dad politely asked me to leave. Before I left, I scream “YOU WANNA ACCUSE ME OF FUCKING STEALING FROM MY OWN FUCKING FAMILY? FUCK YOU!” and left.

My brother was outside when this popped off, so I vented to him. Screaming, swearing, the whole nine yards. Specifically “fuck that motherfucking cunt,” among every name in the book. I said that I wish my sister left him when they had relationship troubles. He heard my rant. 

My brother tried to say that I was taking my sister's boyfriend out of context because he took back his accusation. We argued about that more civilly and I left.

After I got back to my apartment, I sent a text to my brother and my dad saying that I wouldn't be at Easter and that I wanted an apology from my sister's boyfriend. I apologized to my sister for waking her up and left it at that.

My sister's boyfriend wants an apology for swearing at him. My dad and brother think this is reasonable. In their eyes we both acted badly, two wrongs don't make a right, and that I wasn't justified in swearing at him. My brother doesn't think it was an accusation, and my dad thinks I'm overreacting. Because my sister's boyfriend took it back, it wasn't that bad.

My sister is fighting for me, and they've been fighting ever since. I told them I wasn't going to apologize for reacting to his smears and that he crossed the line. My dad and my brother are trying to keep the peace, which I'm disappointed in.

The morning she left, my grandma got sick and I (19F) took her to an urgent care clinic. 6 hours later we're home and I needed to study for midterms (I had 3 midterms that weekend) so I asked my older brother (21 M) to stay with her overnight, i was exhausted. The next morning at 10am she had a huge accident stretching from the bathroom, down the hallway, and to her bedroom. She ran a fever and I called my aunt and she sent my other aunt. We took her to the ER. 11 hours later she was released (it was pneumonia, she's 92). I took extreme care of her for the next 5 days. My dad and brother didn't help. My aunt visited 2 hours for 3/5 days. I barely passed one of my exams that week. The others did during a reading break.



4 weeks later, my mom never booked a flight back to help take the load off, and seh kept pushing my buttons and told me how its bullshit that I ""forced"" people to tell her to come back home beacuse what I went through wasn't a real struggle and that I have life so easy and that whole week of taking care of my grandma and driving her to check up appointments to our doctors office (40 minutes away) wasnt a struggle and that I am a lazy fuck. She undermined all of my struggles that week. I had to sacrifice my grades beacuse of this unexpected emergency and lack of support. I was in my 3rd semester of school. This is not what I signed up for. She told me it wasn't her responsibility since she wasn't in the country. I called her a bitch. then 1 hour later I sent her an apology message telling her that I crossed the line despite every bad thing she said to me. She ignored me for NINE days. 



Once she replied she told me she was ""too busy"" and ""just saw it"". I got mad. 2 days later I called her and we had a heart to heart. She told me everything is okay and she forgives me but never apologized on her part, despite me acknowledging where I went wrong and I never held it against her. After 12 days her flight arrived and I picked her up. 



I thought everything was fine. 13 days later i'm chilling on the couch, she stops cleaning in a different room, marches up to me and demands a 3rd apology.



I am confused on why it's being brought up again, but she led me on to believe that she was. I got pissed but I kept my mouth shut and apologized to avoid conflict and as if that wasn't enough she still never apologized for the way she disrespected me.



Nobody acknowledges that I called her a bitch because she pushed me and pushed me and pushed me and pushed me until I broke and reacted in an irrational way. Its not like she said one bad thing and I crashed out. She just kept coming at me mentally abusing me until I couldn't take it anymore and broke my silence. Now everyone is calling me a brat.

My friend, let's call her W, had a crush on our other friend, I. W had a crush on I for a very long time, and they were always together. A few months ago, we all became friends with with another dude, A. A has been our friend for a while now and is overall a chill guy. Even more recently, I and W became friends a girl, we'll call her Al. (I don't know her very well) ever since they became friends with her, I has become distant from me, W, and our friend group. She started hanging out with other people, pretending like she didn't know me, and even talking trash about W behind her back. W also noticed this and began texting me about it. She told me about how I stopped texting her and was always hanging out with A and Al. (For context, W, I, and Al are all lesbian/into girls.) At some point, my other friend told me that I and Al were dating, but i can't tell anyone bc I'm not supposed to know. Here's where I'm not sure if I'm the A-hole. Today, W texted me about how she was so tired of them hanging out without her and that she just wanted to know the truth. So, I told her. She said that she had suspected it and she was so done with both of them. I reminded her that it's not her fault and that she deserved better,  and she thanked me and said goodnight. She must have told A, bc a few minutes later, i got a long paragraph from him about not sharing people's private information.

1k3xnoe,AITA-Went shopping with husband and we realized we missed the hot dog buns at the beginning of the store…,"So he says,”oh I’ll run back and grab them”.  I say “I’m heading to the hotdogs”. I sit there for literally five minutes. I call, he doesn’t answer. My over worried brain thought he died. Who takes that long to grab hotdog buns?

So I go to the buns and he is not there. 

He called me back and started on with “why would you STAY THERE?!” (Near the hotdogs) (apparently he looked everywhere but there). 

“Why wouldn’t you keep shopping?! I can find you if you keep shopping” he is saying it like I’m an idiot for staying where I said I’d be. Who gets mad at something like this? 

His tone… fuck his tone. I literally hung up and decided he can find me since I “should have kept shopping”.  Did he find me? No. He didn’t.  Guess why? It is hard to find someone moving. He went to the car. He didn’t have the keys. 

So I spent that time shopping on my own. And I took my sweet time. 

What a dumb thing. Now he is pretending like he didn’t yell at me on the phone for being the one place he didn’t look. 

Also, he is trying to tell me he didn’t yell at me. 

K bro, I like to hang up on people I love for fun🤦‍♀️

On top of it all, he didn’t but the buns. So now we have hotdogs without buns. Smfh. ",AmItheAsshole,skyrymproposal,0,0.38,38,2025-04-20 21:59:40+00:00,Everyone Sucks,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k3xnoe/aitawent_shopping_with_husband_and_we_realized_we/,True,Everyone Sucks
1k3w3ct,AITA because I side eyed someone I was friends with after losing a game of dodgeball because of them and then them insulting me based on my disability?,"I have had thoughts about posting this for a long time, but I am a teenager and I will be using fake names.

At school we were playing dodgeball in gym, and my friend, I'll call her B, caused me to lose because she said ""technically that is an out because the ball slipped from his hands!"" even though I caught it first of all. And then while arguing about that I was hit by a ball. I was pretty angry since, she purposefully made me lose the game (which I also kinda view as cheating).

I was talking to one of my friends who was also mad abt that, and he even admitted I could've helped win the game if she didn't distract me. So after gym, I side eyed her. She started verbally bucked at me because of that, saying ""why are you side eying me huh?!"" And so much more. So I told her to ""shut up"" and walked off, and I felt pretty bad because I knew that I just made everything worse. I wanted to apologize at lunch because I knew at first, I was the asshole.

But then, at the last period before lunch, I heard her talking literally behind my back saying ""maybe you shouldn't do that if you can't even walk straight"", which I cannot control since my disability affects my hips and where my femur is placed so I cannot control it. I got pretty angry at that! So I texted my friend and talked to others. 

My other friend, G I'll call him, after lunch said ""I was showing bad sportsmanship"" which I can agree, I was ""But she was wrong for saying that""

My other friend (not from where I am) said that ""I was the asshole at first"" which I can def agree with ""but she is a massive b!tch for using my disability as an insult"" which I definitely agree with.

Another friend (yes I have a big social life kinda) said ""why are you apologising?? This is the end of the school year and I fight with my friends and we still are friends!""

I couldn't talk to my BFF's since she sat next to them, but I hear from G she was causing a ruckus about the situation. So the next day, I decided to apologise, but, she didn't even let me speak. I had an outburst saying ""she also insulted me using my disability"" to one of my friends that I share with her. 

Due to that, I didn't want to play dodgeball, or do anything. I texted my mom, explained everything, and she didn't see anything bad with what I did since I was the bigger person since I apologised for my actions unlike her.

1k3b00r,AITA for negotiating for a fair rent split based off of room proportion after signing the lease?,"My roommate and I just moved into a new appt—$3750 total for two bedrooms. Figuring out rent before signing would’ve been smarter, and I won’t make this mistake again, but now we’re trying to settle on a fair split and I can’t tell if I’m being unreasonable or what to do next.

She found and toured the place first, and we applied before I’d seen it. When I finally did (at night, with no lights), we had 24 hours to decide. The rooms were clearly very different sizes. When touring, she angled herself toward the larger room, so I assumed she wanted it. After we signed, I offered to take the smaller room as long as we adjusted rent. She agreed, and I suggested we measure.

A few days later, she texted suggesting a $100 difference. We hadn’t measured yet, and the rooms were obviously not comparable. She started texting friends and sent examples of equal rent splits- all with similar-sized rooms. Then she told me she can’t pay more than $2,000 a month.

We’d already started moving in—her stuff was everywhere. Not a problem, but it becomes relevant.

I measured the rooms:
	•	Small room: 14,800 in²
	•	Big room: 31,124 in²

Based on square footage, rent would break down to around $1200 (small) and $2550 (large)—not even considering that the small room is off the living room and gets no light, while the big one is private w sunlight.

Still, I offered to pay $1,700—$500 more than proportional—so she’d only pay $2,050. She said she couldn’t go above $2,000. We hit a stalemate, so I proposed splitting rent evenly and switching rooms after six months. She agreed, but added, “I’ll have to put my desk in the living room,” which is already small. Honestly, I don’t think her stuff would fit in the smaller room.

We’re trying this for a month, reassessing after the first utility bill. Friends warned me I might be setting myself up—worried she’ll refuse to switch, push for a square-footage split later, or break the lease.

I’m torn. Part of me thinks I should just suck it up and pay $1,750. But my room barely fits a bed, while hers is literally twice the size. I’m not thrilled about switching either, since I suspect her overflow will end up in the shared space. I don’t think she’s malicious, but I do think she hasn’t considered how small the room really is—or what a swap would involve.

I don’t want to spend six months anxious about whether she’ll follow through. I just want to feel secure, especially financially. She’s easy to talk to but firm on her $2,000 max. I don’t get how she saw both rooms and thought a $100 difference was fair.

Maybe she thought I picked the small room first, but it really seemed like she wanted the big one. I was trying to be generous, but I also need to advocate for myself.

We were loose college friends—not close, but many mutual friends. I want to keep things civil, but I feel like I’m doing all the compromising.

Am I the asshole for taking the small room and asking for a size-based rent split-even though she agreed?

1k357gz,AITA bc i yelled at my gf to change seats with her sister (ex gf),"
for context, I 26M dated the sister of my current girlfriend a few years back, i didn’t knew who was her sister until after we broke up, I met her in a dating app, the first time i met her family, there she was. She was as surprised as i was, but she surprisingly had no issue on me dating her sister.
Fast forward to yesterday, i went to a different country with her sister and my gf family, my ex knew the language of the country we were visiting (which is portuguese) but my girlfriend didn’t, also, both don’t know how to drive (this is important for later). Now, the 3 of us were going to the airport to pick up some of their cousins, but in the way to the airport, the waze of the car we rented was in portuguese and i had no idea of what it was saying, so my ex, suggested on changing seats so that i could hear her better when she translated everything the map said, but my girlfriend refused, and i told her calmly saying that it’s just one time thing, but she said stop yelling, i won’t change seats, that really pissed me off, also the fact that we were in the middle of the street and a bunch of people started to yell at us telling to move, and then i told her, in a higher voice saying: just this fucking time, it’s not like i’m gonna cheat on you, and then she like got quiet and changed seats w her sister, the whole car ride was super quiet, it was just my ex translating the directions. Today she told me that she wanted a break from our relationship, and i agreed, and it technically wasn’t a problem bc i left that house today bc i had work in my country. I don’t know what to do and my last resort was reddit, bc my psychologist told me that the best thing i could do is rant abt the situation to someone or write if i can’t contact him, why do i have a psychologist? bc i have a history of anger issues, but they were pretty much nothing like bad, but they were getting a bit bad this year, maybe that was why i answered so rude to her, but i don’t know *btw if i wrote something incorrect, it’s because English is not my first language* ",AmItheAsshole,emmasdilemmass,0,0.44,47,2025-04-19 20:12:56+00:00,Everyone Sucks,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k357gz/aita_bc_i_yelled_at_my_gf_to_change_seats_with/,True,Everyone Sucks
1k327rh,AITA in this altercation with a friend.,"I've been called out for being a fake person, insincere, and lacking self-awareness.
This person has also argued that I've made them feel isolated.

So l was hanging out with them, and three other people. I was having a conversation, yet this person was not engaging in the chat. I called on them a few times to join into our talk, but they kept minding to themself.
We were talking about games and memes, and this person suddenly changes the conversation to religion and how awful the world is.
I was being a clutz as I accidentally bumped, stepped on someone's shoe, and dropped something. This person said that I need to stop being clumsy, saying ""sorry"" and ""excuse me"" so much that they accused me of purposely annoying them.

After one of the friends leave, I try talking to them again and they responded with ""oh, you're interested in talking to me now that he's gone?"" 
I apologized, and they ranted at me that I steal all the attention from them, that I am douchebag and have made them feel miserable.

I've known this person since my freshman year of high school, I thought we were good until now with them saying that I'm a source to their problems in life. They even said that they despise me for ""easily getting dates with girls."" (I've dated 3 people in the past, currently with a new girlfriend almost a year into our relationship)
I genuinely tried to reconcile with this friend, understanding why they are ranting at me with all of this hatred. However, they continued to berate me that I was never a true friend, that I fucked everything up, and they no longer wanted to see me ever again.

1k2s2u6,"AITA for forgetting to confirm grad pics and snapping after being called disrespectful, even though we already moved past the drama?","This involves my friend Anika, this girl Hannah, and me. I was mostly backing Anika but ended up getting dragged into the mess.

A few weeks ago, we had a late arrival day. Anika asked Hannah for a ride, but Hannah responded super late the night before, so Anika asked me instead. After that, Hannah went cold and never explained anything. I called the way she handled it immature.

Then, out of nowhere, Hannah and her sister Amber unfollowed us on everything and posted shady things that were clearly about us. We didn’t say anything publicly. I only vented to my friend Sam. we just told people Hannah had a family emergency to avoid drama.

Eventually, I messaged Hannah privately to clear the air:

	“I never wanted things to end over something small. The way it ended made me question if you ever wanted to be friends. I still appreciate the friendship we had. If you’re talking bad about me, that’s not okay—Anika and I haven’t. We’re graduating soon. I just want peace.”

She replied saying I disrespected her, backed Anika, and that she never talked about us. Then four days later, she called us and said she wanted to fix everything. We talked and moved on.

Then today, she texts:

	“When’s the date for the grad pics?”

I responded:

	“Sorry, I forgot to tell you. After everything happened, we had to confirm with my sister. When you left the group chats and unfollowed us, we thought you weren’t doing it anymore, so we asked Mary. I’m really sorry.”

She got upset, saying she already bought a dress and that I was being disrespectful by not telling her sooner. I said:

	“Wait I didn’t know you bought a dress. I’ve been on my period and feeling like crap. I forgot. You didn’t reach out either. Don’t come at me like this.”

She replied:

	“Don’t be disrespectful. I’m not stupid. If you weren’t stupid, you’d realize asking a question isn’t coming at you.”

Then her sister Amber DMs me:

	“Are you embarrassed yet? Hope you can get out of bed when your period’s controllable.”

I snapped and said:

	“Yeah I’m messy, but you and your sister keep dragging this. Leave me alone. I don’t even talk to you.”

Then blocked her.

But Hannah kept pushing, so I finally sent:

	“Are you fucking stupid? You left the group chats and unfollowed us why would we think you still wanted in?
I apologized, and I take it back. If it’s that deep, return the dress.
You didn’t even ask until the last minute. That’s on you.
You ghosted us and said you were ‘going through stuff’ so are we. The world doesn’t revolve around you.
If you didn’t want to be in pics, fine, but don’t come at me now.”

Then Amber messaged:

	“After seeing your prom pics, I’m restricting Hannah from doing anything with you. #nocharitywork. Also return the prom dress you need the money.”

So now I’m wondering AITA? I forgot to confirm the photo change and I owned that. But she escalated it, called me stupid and had her sister harass me I never wanted this to blow up again.

1k2lupx,AITAH for venting to my friend about how i felt about someone else and saying a kinda mean thing about them?,"Ok. Let me tell the whole story from the start. So lets call my friends: Emily, Anna, and Kate. So backstory, Anna is friends with Kate out of school. Me, Emily, and Anna go to the same school. Anna talks about Kate a lot. She also sometimes replaces things we were gonna do together by doing them with Kate instead. 

So one time i was texting Emily and venting about it. In one text all i said was “Kate probably sucks at volleyball” because she was replacing me for volleyball. I also said she would probably ditch Anna for the popular kids if she came to our school. (Anna really wants Kate to go to our school). So somehow Emily exposed my vent to Anna and she told Kate and Kate's friend, lets call Lily. So they all got mad at me and Kate even said she might tell the principal and the principal already thinks I’m a bully because of a previous incident that Anna and I did together, (we both were called “bullies” over something harmless)

 now Anna said to ""never do it again to Kate"" and dont get Emily involved cause it was “all me” (but Emily said she agreed with what i said about Kate when I vented) and also the things i said other than that Kate probably sucked at volleyball was that she was replacing me and that Kate and Anna have attachment issues because Anna wouldn’t even let Emily talk to Kate if they ever went on the bus together if Kate ever came to their school. So i vented about it and now everyone hates me and my life is over. 

They are ignoring how i felt about Kate always taking over and putting the blame on me. Btw, Emily and Anna are kinda the duo in my trio. They have known eachother their whole life while i have known them for 3 years. And if Anna tells the principal, i could expose her for something that happened a yesr ago where she bullied me, ditched me and backstabbed me so i dont think its a good idea for her to tell on me but idk if i should day that.

1k2hw4j,AITA for ruining by bestfriends birthday surprice cause i cant stand her bf?,"**A bit of backstory info**: My best friend has been with this guy for almost 2 years, and this guy has truly ruined . He constantly causes problems, gets jealous, causes her immense stress, and generally abuses her emotinally . I’ve told her countless times that she deserves better, but she doesn’t listen 

Anyway, it was her birthday, and with our friend group, we decided to throw her a surprise. Even though I wasn’t thrilled about it (full shade, btw), I thought we should include her boyfriend because I knew it would make her happy. So, *I* suggested  in the group chat we had with the rest of our friends about it , that he should be involved. Another friend of ours, who had a bad history with this guy’s best friend, asked if his best friend would be there too (because unfortunately, those two are like pot and kettle), and I told her obviously not, he has no business being there, and if he shows up, I’ll tell him to leave myself. Then another friend, half-seriously, half-jokingly, asked if it was really necessary for the boyfriend to come, and I, being honest, replied that it’s not my favorite thing, but for our friend, I can tolerate it. Anyway, we discussed a bit more in general, details about the surprise, and suddenly another girl from the group added my best friend’s boyfriend to the group chat. We told him what we had planned, he agreed, and the conversation ended there. I had completely forgotten about the existence of the earlier messages. 

Fast forward to the day of the surprise, and  we’re all waiting for my best friend’s boyfriend because he was supposed to bring the cake and the gift *that we all chipped in for* (*!!!!!!*). But he never shows up, and we’re blowing up his phone, and he doesn’t answer. We end up going to my best friend’s house alone to somehow explain what happened, but she doesn’t open the door even though we know she’s home. To cut a long story short, her brother eventually opens the door, and my best friend angrily tells us to leave. When I ask her what’s wrong, she says her boyfriend saw the messages where we were talking about him and got upset that we were badmouthing him. I admitted it was a mistake, but *he* was the one who didn’t show up and immaturely ruined the surprise. She then told us that he came at midnight with the cake and the gift (the ones *we* paid for, mind you) and gave her a perfectly fine surprise, unlike us, who didn’t bother to swallow our egos. And she especially blamed me, saying that as her best friend, I shouldn’t be talking about her boyfriend behind her back and that I’m to blame for everything. Okay, I get that I made a mistake, but I genuinely don’t think I was the jerk in this situation. Am I wrong? And if so, how can I fix my relationship with my best friend because she means a lot to me?",AmItheAsshole,Subject_Confection77,7,0.58,35,2025-04-18 22:48:46+00:00,Everyone Sucks,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k2hw4j/aita_for_ruining_by_bestfriends_birthday_surprice/,True,Everyone Sucks

1k2aiwu,"AITA: a trucker cussed me out for crossing the street when I wasn't supposed to, but he was speeding.","Context: I am a college student and I was walking back to my building. Just to set the scene, there is a cross walk that basically leads you straight to the entrance of the building. It's at an intersection with stop lights and pedestrian walking lights and stuff. 

Today, as I was walking, I noticed it had the ""dont walk"" signal for pedestrians. But when I looked around, there weren't any cars. All of a sudden this big truck (not really a semi truck, but kind of similar). Comes racing around the corner. The speed limit was 20mph in the street that I was walking across, which i didnt originally know, but i noticed he was going faster than usual. Normally, (since it's a campus) cars will just slow down a bit to give you time to pass, or they'll stop completely, if there's more than one person crossing (especially if there arent other cars behind it) Plus, the light was on yellow, I believe. I started walking across the street and he's going really fast. I kind of stopped for a moment in the middle of the road, then hesitantly moved forward bit by bit because I thought he was slowing down, which would've given me enough time to cross safely. But instead he keeps racing down the street and cussing me out. Mind you, he could've just slowed down to the speed limit and it would've been fine bc the lane he was driving in was at the halfway mark of the cross walk. I would've made it the rest of the way and he wouldn't have run me over. 

Idk, I know it's not that big of a deal, and maybe it was dumb for me to cross when the ""don't walk"" signal is on, but i also don't think it's justified to cuss ppl out.

If a senior failed a class in the fourth marking period, they would have to stay again the next year and be a ""Super Senior"" and the seniors don't technically get out of school until the end of May.

1k1ox6h,AITA for asking my friends to rewatch a tv episode?,"Hi! My friends and I have been watching TV shows together for a while. The group usually includes me, my cousin Ana, her boyfriend Francis, Ana's sister Clara, and sometimes my brother James (though he’s not involved in this situation). We take turns choosing what to watch, often picking shows someone’s already seen. Most recently, we watched *Attack on Titan* at Ana and Francis’ suggestion—even saw the finale in theaters.

It was my turn to pick, so I suggested *The Last of Us*, which I had already seen with my brother, but no one else in the group had finished. We'd tried watching it a year ago and made it through the first episode twice, but never followed through. Everyone agreed to try again, and we added Clara.

A few days later, I asked Ana if we could include our friend Marco, who’s been going through a rough time. We’ve been trying to cheer him up and include him in our plans. Ana said yes, so I invited Marco and he agreed.

Here’s where things got messy. I told Ana we should rewatch episode 1 together since Marco and Clara hadn’t seen it, and because it had been over a year. She refused, saying she’d already watched it multiple times and didn’t want to “waste time.” I reminded her I’d be rewatching the whole season and pointed out she just rewatched all of *AOT*. She argued the episode was too long. I said we should do it for Marco, and she finally agreed—but only if we watched it at double speed.

That same day, I asked the group if they wanted to start watching that night. Francis didn’t respond because he was gaming with two friends, Jhon and Jhosh. I joined them (even though I hate the mode they were playing) and asked again. Francis said yes, but Jhon and Jhosh, who had never watched shows with us before and had already seen *TLOU*, asked to join. I said sure.

Just before we started, Francis said we should skip episode 1 since he had already seen it. Jhon and Jhosh agreed and started prepping episode 2. I reminded them Marco and Clara hadn’t seen episode 1. They said it was too long and they'd rather move ahead. I said we always rewatch things and it’s about the shared experience, but they insisted Marco and Clara could just watch it on their own.

The conversation went on for 20 minutes. I finally said I thought it was selfish—by their logic, I could’ve told them to watch it on their own since I’d already seen it. That’s not the spirit of the group. I hung up, saw them keep gaming, and messaged Marco to apologize. He wasn’t too upset, but agreed it was weird—they could’ve just played the episode and chilled.

Now I’m not sure what’s going to happen. We’re supposed to watch the finale of another show tomorrow, but I’m waiting to see if anyone says something. If not, I’ll just watch it alone because I don’t want spoilers (which I usually get while waiting for everyone to agree on a time).

1k1k26a,AITA for telling my friend myIQ test score is higher than theirs after they called me “fake smart” in front of everyone,"this happened over the weekend and now half our friend group is weird about it



we were at a house party, kinda late, convo got dumb as usual and my friend (i’ll call her L) kept interrupting everything i said. i corrected her on something small (she said the moon doesn’t spin??) and she rolled her eyes and said “you act like you’re some genius but you’re just fake smart”



everyone laughed. i didn’t.



so i said, pretty calmly, “you know i actually took the IQ test last month and scored 134. that’s gifted range. so idk if that makes me fake smart but it's definitely smarter than average”



the room went quiet. one guy literally said “damn.” she turned bright red and said “well i could take that test and score higher” and i just said “then do it.”



next day she blocked me on everything and now two mutual friends said i embarrassed her and should’ve just let the comment go. but i didn’t even bring it up first. like i get that it sounded like a flex but why is it okay to call me dumb in front of people but not okay for me to respond with facts

1k0pxqf,AITA for not throwing away a piece of plastic,"let me explain, me and my bf are young we still live with our parents, because we both cannot to live by ourselves and i'm still going to school. this Sunday we were both hanging out and well one thing led to another and we had sex. we used a condom and after we even bought a take action emergency contraception to be extra safe. We were in the car when i. took the pill and he was telling me to throw it out the car window, something about me is i hate hate! littering it's a huge pet peeve of mine, so i waited until we got to a gas station and i threw out the box and well i thought everything else. the issue is i accidentally didn't take out all the pieces that i put in my purse, i left the small packaging the pill came in inside my purse. when i got home i emptied my purse and took everything out and i realized that this plastic was still there so i threw it away in a trash can i have in my room. also, just to add on i am on medication for other things so it just looked like something related to that and i didn't think much of it. a couple days after my mom confronted me when my dad was out the house, she cussed me out, called me a whore and 'easy'. she though it was BC but at that point i fessed up and told her the truth. both me and my boyfriend are adults and i feel like we should be able to have sex especially safe sex. After that i told my boyfriend what happened and he started basically calling me an idiot and was telling me i was being careless and ""why didn't you listen to me when i told you to throw it out the car window"" and started to get extremely angry with me and blamed me for ruining the relationship he has with my mom. My mom on the other hand was calling me all of the names on the book. i understand her frustration because me and my boyfriend don't have a set future and anything can happen. my mom was telling me my boyfriend was going to leave me if i came out pregnant and that i was an idiot for allowing him to have me the was he did. so, am i the asshole?",AmItheAsshole,Pea-in-a-pod3794,0,0.5,8,2025-04-16 17:19:35+00:00,Everyone Sucks,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k0pxqf/aita_for_not_throwing_away_a_piece_of_plastic/,True,Everyone Sucks
1k0ngnx,AITA for refusing to like my friend’s post unless she like mine first?,"Alright, I need some input because I might be trippin’ here. I’ve been friends with this person for some time, but lately, I’ve been getting super annoyed with how she is acting on social media.

So here’s the thing: she post all the time and always tag me asking me to like her stuff. I mean, I get it, everyone wants some love on their posts, but here’s where I’m at: she NEVER like my posts back. Feels like she is just using me for the likes, y’know? Like, what’s the point of supporting her if they can’t return the favor?   
  
So I decided to hit her with the “I’m not liking your posts unless you like mine first” rule. Fair, right? But every time I don’t like her stuff, I get a message like, “Oh, you didn’t like my post? 😕” with that weird vibe. Like, really?

I tried explaining, like, “If you want me to engage, at least throw me a like too,” but she just don’t get it. Now things are mad awkward every time she post. I know I’m probably being a little petty, but honestly, this feels like the only way she'll get it.

1k0jyvw,AITAH for being jealous of my friend?,"The process of applying to scholarships has been very stressful. I’m a senior in high school and I’m not necessarily an “impressive” student, I have pretty good stats, but not anything amazing.

My friend, on the other hand, has been able to get multiple full ride scholarships and grants due to her financial status.

A couple weeks ago, I found out I won two scholarships that totaled out to be $3000. I was pretty excited about this, since I hadn’t heard back from any other scholarships that I had applied to previously, so I was getting pretty hopeless about being able to pay for college (my FAFSA SAI was a 13800 so im not receiving any financial aid from the government nor any college I got into, even though my parents can’t afford to help me pay for college). I told my friend about my scholarships, and she didn’t congratulate me once, the only thing she said was “That’s not bad. I’m lucky I don’t have to pay for college. In fact, I’m getting reimbursed for my tuition.”

I guess that comment threw me off guard a little? I’m obviously very happy that she doesn’t have to worry about the cost of college— and I have told her that many times in the past— but I just felt as if that wasn’t the best moment to bring it up. I know that just because I’m not getting full rides to college like she is doesn’t mean that she shouldn’t be able to celebrate her success but maybe it felt dismissive in that moment. I ended up just saying something like “Oh, nice” or “Good job!”

Yesterday, the results for a scholarship that many incoming freshmen get came out, and I knew that I probably wasn’t getting it, since the scholarship is heavily based off of financial need. My friend and I opened up our decisions together, and just as I expected, I didn’t get it. My friend, though, did. Right in that moment, I felt pretty disappointed that I didn’t get the scholarship, even though I saw it coming. I said “Congrats!! I’m jealous” because honestly, yes I’m pretty jealous of all the financial aid she’s receiving, but my tone + facial expressions definitely didn’t match the happiness I was trying to convey.

I guess she didn’t take this the way I intended, she was acting off and barely talked to. Later on, she told me that she didn’t think it was fair for me to be mad at her for being poor. This made me pretty angry since I was never mad at her for anything. Maybe I shouldn’t have said I was jealous of her, even though I meant it in the best way possible. I’m definitely not jealous of her financial situation, but I’m also very definitely jealous of the financial aid she’s receiving.

So again, the fact that she was accusing me of “being mad at her because she was poor” really did make me mad, since all the times she tells me about what scholarships she got, I always make sure to congratulate her, even when she’s dismissing my own accomplishments. I feel like it’s normal to be disappointed and jealous all at once.

1k0g79s,AITA for refusing to go under my father's care?,"[16m] I'm currently in high school and yeah i'll just make bullet points to make it more comprehensible.

1. I am a part of the school soccer team, and there's this one dude who was my friend in elementary school. I currently would consider him a friend asw but not really THAT close. Most of the other teammates have the same relationship w me.&#10;


2. My parents divorced when i was 10 due to excessive fighting and arguing and then my dad went no contact. My mom got rlly depressed and started drinking a lot. She also would skip work a lot. She also gets fits of rages which existed before divorce too where she can yell at anyone around her including me and thrash around. I would be stuck trying to make her sleep after drinking, doing chores, taking car eof the house and helping her w financial budgeting. She also currently has a boyfriend who she argues with a lot.&#10;


3. One day, my teammates (there were like 10) came over for pizza and vid games. I didn't know my mom would come home early from drinking and she was w her bf. She was pretty drunk so she was yelling at me in front of them so i tried taking her to another room and then she started throwing things around and obv that startled the teammates so i told the bf to handle it while i took them out for a pizza instead. &#10;


4. After a couple of days, my father shows up on our door. I got confused because why is he here and what does he want? Turned out that elementary school friend told his mom and he wanted her to call my dad about everything he knew. He also told my dad that i am supposedly ""depressed"", ""overworked"", ""angry"" because i was distant from other people, skipping school (can't i take a break?), talking back to teachers (only bec they were genuinely being illogical). Depressed? This is illogical because the only person that needs help is my mom. My dad then overstepped by telling me that i should be under his care now and he'd fight for it. Really? Its so stupid bec you have been no contact for years and now you decide to talk to me bec of a single call from someone i am not close to? I refused and told him he should instead pay for mom's therapy. I'll be fine bec i have a life and everything. My mom doesn't.&#10;


After that, i was just really angry at the friend for not talking to me beforehand and just throwing me into this unwanted situation. I decided to leave the soccer team too.

1k08ore,AITA for getting my friend kicked out of the Minecraft Movie,"AITA for getting my friend kicked out of the Minecraft

my friends and I went to watch the Minecraft movie recently. Unless u are living under a rock you probably know it’s become kind of a meme People are going full cosplay, screaming at scenes from the trailer, throwing popcorn it’s chaotic but in a kind of funny shared internet moment kind of way.

We were all down to be part of the fun but like within reason. Our group (11 of us) showed up, had our diamond swords and  light blue t shirts and dark blue joggers and we were all vibing. I was one of the people who set up this event i put in alot of effort making sure everyone could come and making the seating set up. One of our friends Jake me and him aren't very close but we are in the same friend group 

Before the trailers even ended, Jake was already throwing popcorn around he also started singing the creeper aw man song I told him to stop and he just brushed me off saying, “No one cares bro its just trailers ill stop when the movie starts.”

The moment that really pissed me off though was when, during the WATER BUCKET RELEASE scene, he stood up and threw his entire drink into the middle of our group.we were all soaked. I was sitting there with Sprite all over my new pants that I bought for the movie.

I was already mad and told him straight up that he needed to calm down or just leave. He laughed and told me to stop crashing out. Then came the infamous chicken jockey scene I was expecting a couple cheers I was planning on doing it too but Jake absolutely lost his mind. He screamed like a fricking banshee (can i swear on here idk?) He also jumped up on his seat and threw the rest of his popcorn bucket there wasnt much left. I saw the theater staff eyeing our row.

I told mu friend who I was sitting next to that I was getting some sweets but I actually went down to go talk to an employee I was worried they were gonna kick not only Jake out and the rest of us too I talked to the employee and told him jakes seat number and said he was acting out of control and I said sorry. They came over shortly after i came back from buying sweets and They kicked him out. The rest of us stayed and actually got to enjoy the rest of the movie (surprisingly decent, tbh).

Now Jake's furious saying I snitched and ruined the night (i have no idea how he found out it was me maybe i was to obvious). A couple of our friends are saying I was too harsh and that we all knew it was gonna be a wild experience anyway so I should’ve just let it go.

But man we were drenched, embarrassed, and not really having fun thanks to him.

1k077rb,"AITA for confronting my best friends wife, a week after their marriage?","\*\*\*-Please its a situation in an asian country i request all of western people to stay far from this post-\*\*\*  
My ex-bffs, Andy & Vas, just got married. I’d known them for 10 years since college. They were high school sweethearts who befriended me early on. I was dating a girl, Pra, until they introduced me to Dizzy. The 4 of us were a circle back then. One day, they asked what I thought of Dizzy-“just friends.” wo me, which changed everything

A fight broke out between Vas and Pra in the hostel. Andy, Vas,& Dizzy blamed Pra, and I, being the youngest and most naive, believed them. I cut Pra off, I (later found out Vas called her a psycho and that I would never love her in front of whole hostel) . After that, most girls in college avoided me. I spiraled into depression and poor health. I left the hostel and began seeing doctors weekly.

Only Dizzy spoke to me, and out of desperation ( been 5 months i talked to a girl properly), I asked her out. She rejected me, and soon both girls ghosted me. Dizzy started sleeping around with classmates, and people rub it in my face. I had three nervous breakdowns but kept it from my parents due to their heart conditions. I barely made the final year due to health issues.

Andy convinced me to join the gym, it made my health worse. I once fainted in front of Vas and she walked away. Andy later apologized for her.  
Me and andy applied for a job after college; Andy helped, but the girls still ignored me. In meantime Andy's sis  was getting married and he asks me to confront groom beforehand. We both go meet personally, I asks everything about him(bad habits and worse too). Good response and meantime we both now training for same company. Later, I met Vas after 3 years she barely acknowledged me. Andy kept asking for favors, but when it came to the final job exam, he helped everyone but me. I didn’t get the job, and he also didnt invite me for his sister's marriage but apologized about it later.

During COVID, I got better and got a job as Andy’s senior in the same company. He was jealous, you can see through it. He told me, Dizzy had moved in a serious relationship for last 3 years. I nearly broke down again but stayed composed. I asked him not to mention her again, he kept doing it anyway.

5 months ago, I moved abroad for master’s and recently saw their engagement post. Andy, texted daily, but hadn’t invited me . When I asked, gave excuses and told I’d be the best man at their wedding. I even prepared a gift of honey moon trip as sponsorship. They got married last week ,invited others, including Dizzy and a guy Andy hated. No one told me.

I even invited them all to my sister’s wedding. Some came. Still, none of them informed me about Andy’s.  
I feel like I lost 10 years to fake friends and emotional manipulation from all of them. I reached out Pra, she still replies to me in an instance but she's now in a good relationship.

1k02nl7,AITA- Told My Roommate I Don’t Want Random People in our Apartment,"I’ll start off by saying that I know that I’ve been in the wrong with this situation before. I am not an angel in this and if the comments agree that I’m an asshole, I can totally understand why. 

In our apartment, we don’t really get along which I don’t expect us all to be best friends. We’re three random people (24F, 29M and 27F) living together in an apartment, there is going to be some head butting. 

I’ve had my boyfriend over many times to stay overnight. I’m not saying that my roommate can’t have people over, it’s his house too. The only problem is that my roommate instead of asking for permission to have people over, he just kind of announces that some people will stay over. I would be fine with it if it was every once in a while.

Instead I would say that within the last two months he’s had like five/six friends stay over multiple days (once almost two weeks without asking) and just says they’re coming without asking what we think. Literally this: “My friend is coming over from Thursday to Friday”. We haven’t really discussed this situation, like having a sit down to make boundaries about the visitor situation. 

My roommate rightfully pointed out that I’ve had my boyfriend over many, many times. I know that we’ve probably bothered them too. My boyfriend also never stays over for more than a day or two. I also never have random friends sleep over at my house. 

My issue is that it’s several random people I don’t know staying in my house. I don’t know what their character is like or if they can be trusted having access to my room/bathroom when I’m not at home. My roommates know who my boyfriend is and generally keeps to himself and we don’t play music very loudly. This roommate’s friends play music loudly and talk extremely loudly too. 

I think this was a conversation that was bound to happen but after my roommate, once again, announced that a stranger was going to stay over three nights in a row, just invited his girlfriend over. I’m sick of having random people over without any say of how long they are allowed to stay. I know I’ve been inconsiderate myself and I said sorry for the situation, but I feel like because it’s my house too.

1jzvl94,AITA for telling my gfs mother she’s horrible.,"Okay so throwaway because my gf uses Reddit and I don’t need her to know I hate her mom yet. 

So I 19meters (lol) have a gf 19f. She’s the kindest sweetest person in the world, like genuinely. 

My problem is my gfs mother. She’s a horrible old lady and I hate her with every fibre of my being. She’s so mean to my gf no matter how much she does for her mom. Like yesterday my gf was sick and I went to go see her. She’s got her periods and the flu so like it’s a war zone. She’s throwing up, can barely walk and crying 24/7. I spend most of the day with her since I work night shift and she had sick leave.

And the whole reason she’s sick is because of her brothers. Her mom literally rubbed her brothers, made them soup and coddled them the whole time they were sick but she gave not one single fuck today. My gf was throwing up the whole day, not once did she ask if she was okay or if she needed anything. She acted like it was an inconvenience and my poor baby was crying. How can you treat your own daughter like this? 

Here’s where I may be the ah. As I was leaving, my gf was asleep in her room and her mom was downstairs coddling her little brother. I stopped and I asked her to just check on my gf through the night to make sure she’s okay and she gave me such a dirty look and like it genuinely pissed me off. I told her ‘she’s a horrible mother who for some reason hates the child who does the most for her and treats her lazy unhelpful sons like the sun shines out of their asses’ and then left. My gf hasn’t messaged me yet to berate me so maybe that’s good but am I the ahole?

ETA: she texted me back. She still likes me😩

Eta: hello everybody. Just to clarify a few things her brothers are 15 and 23. Her mother is not abusive, bitchy and kind of a c u next Tuesday? Yes. Also for those of you wondering if she's safe. Yes she is. She's staying at my house for the time being and were both supposed to be napping rn but I can't but she's snoring. We did find an apartment that's close to her school and quite safe. That's all I wanted because honestly I would hate to leave her alone at night by herself. We get to move in by the end of this month and were taking her cat. He's a nice grumpy old guy. Like he's 10 years old, I think that's old in cat years. Oh and to those of you trolls who were sooo pissed off that I actually like my gf, I hope you find someone to love you because bitter is not a good look. I have no idea how to update so Mb. I usually just scream into the void on my main. Bye love y'all😫

ETA: teeny tiny update but I’m happy to say that the monster in law is finally sick and now she’s suffering and my gf has been doing absolutely nothing to help her. Karma!

1jznt6u,AITA for making fun of a guy for not apologising?,"A friend (21M) said a slur, and another friend (25F) messaged him basically asking what that was about. 

He said he felt backed into a corner after having his world view questioned during the conversation he said it in and had wanted to go home for ages at that point, but that he apologised at the time and that it wouldn’t happen again. 25F pointed out that he didn’t actually apologise at the time and said that if hanging out with us made him ___phobic then maybe he should have just left. He said “idk what you want me to say”. She said maybe to take accountability and he didn’t reply. 

I asked him about that conversation next time I saw him and he snapped that he tried to explain but 25F immediately just started “yabbering on and hurling accusations at him”. We had an argument in person that we reached a tentative peace on. Later I messaged him saying that he had been really rude about 25F and he didn’t reply. 

I was potentially meant to be staying with 21M over the summer for an event. While we were texting the next day, I found a TikTok that said “apologise like a man in the comments” and the top comment was “idk what you want me to say”, word for word what he said to her about the slur. I sent it to him saying “you” and he said “if you still want to stay in my house I suggest not pissing me off at every opportunity”. 

I was pretty angry about that and the friendship dissolved. But I’m wondering was I the AH for bringing that up when I was meant to be staying in his house? In my head he had been really rude to 25F and not apologised for it so I saw it as fair game, but I’m wondering if I’m in the wrong for provoking him and being surprised when he said that about his house after.

1jzi7f0,AITA - for folding someone else laundry,"Hello, It's my first time in the subreddit but l'm actually curious since something just happened to me. 

Background information: I'm Italian currently living in South Korea, and for work I'm now travelling in the USA. 

In our hotel here in the States there is a room with two laundry and two dryer machines, me and my colleague went to do our laundry and up until that everything was fine, when we unloaded our clothes and needed the dryer we realised both were occupied but finished during our washing time (30 minutes) and then tried to wait 25 minutes to see if someone would come pick them up. 

After none showed we decided to open one to use it and fold their clothes and then went to the lobby waiting. In this time a lady came to speak to the receptionist and seemed mad but I was minding my business on the phone so I didn't pay attention to the conversation, I just noticed that she was mad when she said raising her voice ""I'll write a review to complain, you need to put a sign"" and then left. 

She came back again and asked us if we were the one who folded her laundry and I told her yes, and she start attacking me, saying that I shouldn't dare touch other people property, I tried to explain to her that we waited for someone to come but since none showed up we folded the clothes to use the machine and we're sorry if it bothered her in any way, but she kept going, also shouting at me insisting that I was there while she complained to the receptionist and pretended not to listen, when I tried to say that I was sorry again for the inconvenience she bursted saying I should just shut up and not touch people things. 

Here's the thing: automatic laundry places are not a thing where I grew up and where I'm living now (Seoul) it already happened to me multiple times for people to unload my clothes from the dryer, and I found it rude only when they didn't fold it, so in my mind if the person doesn't show up it's ""normal"" to solve it that way. Is there a laundry etiquette l'm not aware of? Was I unintentionally an asshole?",AmItheAsshole,Ambitious-Middle-132,0,0.45,41,2025-04-15 03:36:30+00:00,Everyone Sucks,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1jzi7f0/aita_for_folding_someone_else_laundry/,True,Everyone Sucks
1jz4mex,AITA For Telling A Ex-Friend That She's Not In A Fucking Wattpad Novel?,"

Ok so I'm 16F and my ex-friend,who I'll call Lila,is also 16F.
Me and Lila were in a friend group that formed in our homeroom with 2 other girls,Belle(16F) & Katie(16F). 

I became friends with Lila and introduced her to most of my friends and everything was fine for a while.
Then this annoying ass fucking girl started to constantly need to have all attention on her. Like bitch chill. Anyways she would cling to me at all times and at first I didn't say anything, despite me not liking physical touch unless I initiate it or they ask permission(which she never did),I didn't want to embarrass her or make her feel bad.

But it escalated,she proceeded to buy me small things then demand I pay her back for them, despite me telling her not to buy me things.
It pissed me off because this girl regularly gets an weekly allowance of at least $100 while I'm lucky enough to get $5 a week.

She had been going behind my back to MY friends and telling them how I was lucky to be her friend & that if it weren't for her I'd be all alone,like bitch the only reason she had friends was because I was her friend but whatever.

Anyways I dropped her as gently as I could telling her I needed space.
After I dropped her literally all her 'friends' stopped talking to her, everyone just ignores her now and I feel extremely bad about it,or I did until she decided that we were friends again and kept trying to cling to me.

It reached a point where I told her in our homeroom that we weren't in some fucking Wattpad fanfiction and that I wasn't going to magically get over everything she did. She started crying and looking around the room as if expecting fucking Harry Styles to walk in and propose or sum shit. When she realized that no one was going to defend her she started crying harder and said-( this is a direct quote btw)
 ""You are a friendless fucking savage, It's no wonder your dad fucking left you""

Btw I am mixed? I have multiple ethnicities but the culture that my mother raised me in was our Native American/Indigenous People culture,so the ""savage comment"" caught me off guard ngl.
Which ouch,ok,but wtv,only problem is that backfired on her,bc Katie & Belle started to yell at her.

She ran out crying.

I feel like TA for making her cry,I never wanted for her to lose her friends or be hurt I just wanted her to stop touching me.My mom says I should have just stayed her friend.
So AITA?

!Btw I js want to say that I DID start to enforce my boundaries. I would tell her I don't like to be touched and would push her off of me,this is usually when she would play the victim card and start crying,this is around the time I decided I needed to stop talking to her!",AmItheAsshole,igkms_0150,6,0.58,19,2025-04-14 17:28:46+00:00,Everyone Sucks,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1jz4mex/aita_for_telling_a_exfriend_that_shes_not_in_a/,True,Everyone Sucks
1jz3od0,AITA for confronting my boyfriend’s mom after feeling excluded from their family?,"I (20F) have been dating my boyfriend (20M) for over a year. From the beginning, I tried hard to be close to his family. I’d help his mom clean the house, cook, with work stuff, and I truly enjoyed it. I even opened up to her emotionally — something I never managed to do with my dad. She became a mother figure to me, especially since I live far from my own family.

I made desserts for their Sunday lunches more often than I ever did for my own family. I wanted to be part of them. But over time, I noticed things. His parents didn’t make much of an effort to include me. They ignored my parents during visits, didn’t greet my dad when he came over, and made comments that felt like they were trying to minimize my relationship.

After a recent trip, I heard more of those comments and decided to distance myself to protect my peace. That’s when his mom reached out, mostly asking about her son. I replied explaining I needed space, that I felt unwelcome and like an outsider. Her response was to call me immature and mock me for being raised by nannies — saying I shouldn’t talk about anyone else’s upbringing. That hurt deeply, especially since I’ve worked hard to be independent — passing a federal exam at 17, commuting 30km to study, coming home at midnight, waking at 5am.

The day after our message exchange, I went to her house to talk. She looked at me with disdain and said she had nothing to say to me, only to her son. She also told me not to stay there. I felt disposable after everything I had given — not just to my boyfriend, but to the entire family.

Later, I found out she told my boyfriend that I was turning him against her — something I’ve never done. I encouraged him to return to school, to grow, but somehow I always end up as the villain.

Then, within 24 hours, he said things were “resolved” with his parents. I doubted it. He called his dad to confirm, and his dad basically dismissed everything, saying the only issue was that I came by ""too late."" Once again, all my feelings (and even my parents’) were invalidated. It led to another fight, and we broke up.

Now he says the only problem was the time of day I showed up, but that feels like gaslighting. I feel like my trust is shattered. I don’t know if I should go back to this relationship — I’m afraid it will never be stable because of how his parents treat me.

AITA for confronting his mom and standing up for myself after all this?

1jyxwpn,AITA for not opening the door for my friend and her partner that passed by without notice? Plot twist: she wanted to ask me as godmother for her baby who she is pregnant with.,"It was a Sunday morning, 9 AM. I got a message from my friend that she wanted to come by to see our new house with her boyfriend (my husband and I have moved to a new house since a couple of weeks). I saw the message, but didnt reply immediately - as I was still laying in my bed with my husband, after a rough night of being sick from being pregnant with my first child. I decided after an hour to reply to her message if she could come by this evening, as I wasnt home (actually still in my bed, so stupid lie; but didnt want to hurt her feelings by saying that I was home and just didnt feel like it). The rest of the day was planned with visits to both my parents and parents in law, so the day was already fully booked.
So, at 10 AM, I send out that message; and she immediately calls me saying that she and her partner were at the front door and if we could open the door for them. I looked at my husband and sighed; I reaaaally didnt feel like it. So I again said that we were not home, but that she was very welcome in the evening. She said she had a present for me and left it at the frontdoor. 30 minutes later, I got to the front door and I see a card and some flowers with the message: “Do you want to be my godmother?” (She is expecting a baby as well). I felt awful. I decided to call her after we got back from my parents and parents in law, in the evening. When I called her she was very emotional. “Why didnt you open the door? I felt really unwelcome”. So that lie from me not being home was not really efficient, and I decided to just be honest by saying that we were still in bed and it was not a really good time - and that I felt really bad that she asked me as a godmother and that whole moment was just ruined now. She was crying and crying, and I did not know what to say. I said sorry a hundred times, but it didnt came through… So now I feel bad. And feeling like an asshole for not just opening the door at a Sunday morning at 10 AM.

1jythm8,AITA for not inviting the girlfriend (whom I have never met) of an uncle to our small wedding?,"I (F, 32) and my fiancé (M, 33) are getting married in 3 weeks. We’ve been together for 13 years and didn’t see the urgency in getting married, but we do fancy a party—so here we are.

In our culture, it’s customary to have two types of guests: day guests and evening guests. Day guests experience the ceremony, reception, and dinner; after dinner, the party starts and the evening guests join. We have a very small number of day guests because we wanted an intimate wedding and a bigger party. Only 32 of our closest friends and family are invited as day guests.

One of them is the uncle of my fiancé—we’ll call him Uncle Rick. When we received the RSVPs, we noticed the name of someone we didn’t know. Let’s call her Hanna. Apparently, Hanna is Rick’s girlfriend. They’ve been together for about 3 years on and off, but I have never met her. She has never attended any events that Rick *did* attend, such as Grandma’s birthday (Rick’s mother), my father-in-law’s big birthday party, or any Christmas dinner. So, I have never met her.

My fiancé briefly spoke to her about 2 years ago at another wedding, but doesn’t really know her either.

When we saw her RSVP, we called Uncle Rick and let him know that she was not invited to the wedding because I’ve never met her, and we only want people we’re really close to at the ceremony. She *was* invited to join the party in the evening. Uncle Rick seemed understanding but said he would no longer attend as a day guest, and would instead join Hanna as an evening guest. My fiancé was disappointed, but we can’t control other people’s decisions.

Now, a week later, my fiancé received a call from his father, asking if we would reconsider inviting Hanna as a day guest. Apparently, Grandma found out Hanna wasn’t invited and is furious. She even said she wouldn’t attend the wedding of her grandchild if Hanna wasn’t invited. Rick’s brother and his son also agree and said they won’t come if Hanna isn’t a day guest either.

Apparently, all of them have met Hanna and know her—but *I* have never met her. I don’t do well with emotional blackmail, but my fiancé is very upset and considers caving in to avoid drama.

1jyorzh,AITAH GF (33F) accused me (39M) of bullying her children,"Posted in r/advice but I think this might belong here instead.

My girlfriend of 2.5 years has 5 children, from 2 previous marriages.  We live separately at the moment, saving for a house.  We live 30 min away from each other.  Different towns.  This is mainly about the youngest 4.  Ages are 6, 8, 10, and 13.  She shares custody with her ex-husband, this week is her week with the 10, and 13 year old.  

Earlier, she texted me saying the 8 year old, wants to come back by her, bc his dad has the internet shut off, and apparently the water was turned off.  Aside from the obvious, of whether cps should be called.  Since we live apart atm she relies on her ex to pick the kids up from school on her week bc of work.  She doesn’t want to cause waves, or drama.  

This is where I may have screwed up, and this whole thing started.  I initially read that the 8 year old wanted to come back to gf house because there was no Internet so he could not play video games.  So my first thought was he doesn’t need video games all the time, he should find something else to do.  He’s being a baby about it, then after I finished reading, I saw the “no water” part so I’m thinking OK that’s valid.  But then I said exactly everything I thought word for word back to my girlfriend, which she then accused me of bullying her children.  

Some more context the younger 4 more or less break down, and cry when there’s no internet.  None of the younger three seem to know what to do with themselves if video games, or TV privileges are taken away. The 10 and 13 year-old have literally started crying when they can’t do any of those.  

Only when talking with my girlfriend when issues like that come up have I told her, that her kids are “being babies” because there’s plenty of other things to do.  

Also want to point out that since she has been divorced, she doesn’t have a lot of time to parent them and I’m working most of the time so I am unable to help 75% of the time.  She was the one that did activities with them all the time outside of the house, but now that they’re separated.  That’s pretty much nil.  

Idk if it’s just kids being kids which I understand for the younger two but the older ones I don’t feel like they should be breaking down that much.  I’m also inexperienced with acting as a parent.  Gf has said I’m great with the kids.  But accusing me of bullying them has me questioning whether I’m the asshole here, or just lacking experience.

1jymj11,AITA for snapping at my roommate over her not cleaning her shit stains in the toilet?,"I (23F) have been living with my roommate (18F) since January. We met at hair school (both dropped out) and were friends before moving in. The first month was fine—typical roommate stuff like dishes and cleaning, nothing major.

A few weeks ago, I found out she didn’t know you’re supposed to use the toilet brush to clean poop stains after using the bathroom. She thought it was only for cleaning with products and said using the brush for both is “spreading shit around.” I offered to buy a second brush to compromise and moved on.

She has a boyfriend (20M) who’s over constantly and doesn’t help clean. She barely does either—maybe the bathroom once or twice a month. They were away for a month (end of Feb to mid-March) and I handled all the cleaning, even bringing in her boyfriend’s weekly food boxes.

Even before our recent fight, things were getting tense. She started throwing my packages on the ground in the entryway, calling me a liar about trash/recycling (I take it out 90% of the time), and generally being passive-aggressive.

The breaking point was yesterday. I was getting ready for work (I work at a club and get home at 3am), and she texted me last minute demanding I hand wash the pots and pans because she thinks the dishwasher “damages” them. I told her politely I’d do it after work since I was already late. She insisted I do it now. I repeated I’d take care of it when I got home.

While in the bathroom, I texted her asking to please clean the toilet after herself—it’s gross when she leaves shit stains, and it’s embarrassing when I have guests over who notice. Meanwhile, she complains if I leave a crumb on the kitchen counter. Make it make sense.

She responded that “this isn’t how she was raised” and she’s not going to change for me. I was super frustrated and FaceTimed a friend to vent—he knows all the roommate drama and has seen the pattern. I went off (not proud of it), saying I think she’s stupid, has no common sense, and that her brain is the size of a seed. I was yelling—completely pushed to my limit. I thought she wasn’t home.

She was. She heard everything. She barged into the bathroom, finally cleaned the toilet (after 3-4 days of the same stain), and muttered, “hope you stop complaining now.” The irony is she’s the one who constantly complains about everything I do that’s not her way.

Some extra context:

1. I’m renting a room in her dad’s apartment. She doesn’t pay rent. Neither does her boyfriend.
2. I’m actively looking to move out.
3. The apartment is always clean because I clean it. I wipe counters, the stovetop, the bathroom sink, and don’t leave makeup or hair anywhere. Meanwhile, she leaves hair all over the shower and stains in the toilet.
I know I said mean things and should’ve handled that better, but I feel like I’ve been pushed to my limit. She refuses to compromise, expects everything to go her way, and I’m the one constantly walking on eggshells.

AITA for finally snapping over this?


UPDATE:

I moved alone about a week ago, everything is so good & i’m sooo happy. Signed the lease and everything.

I had to get her dad/owner of the apartment into it because she got really disrespectful to me when texting me to get my stuff, saying she didn’t want me there and things of the sort. Now, I’m dealing with her dad for the final packages, nothing is left there.

1jyl1xn,AITA for siding with my dad in the divorce even though he cheated on my mom?,"
My dad(52m) and my mom(49f) separated nearly 8 months ago due to my dad having an affair. I(17f) understand that my dad is in the wrong and cheating is never ok but recently I’ve found myself resenting my mom due to her reaction to the divorce.

She has been putting voice recorders in all of our vehicles, including mine. There is no way to know where else these are hidden it makes me feel uncomfortable to talk out loud even in my own home. She also put cameras all around our house hoping to catch my dad since he is no longer allowed in our home. She even put one directly in front of my bedroom which has not been removed even though I told her it seemed weird to me especially since I’ve given her no reason not to trust me and didn’t see a purpose behind putting a camera there. 

My dad had to buy a new phone since she could still log into his Apple ID and would go through it as well as log into his facebook and other social medias. Her email was the recovery email for all his passwords seeing as my dad has never been good with technology. Even after buying a new phone she somehow still has access to his location, I’m not sure how but I wouldn’t be surprised to find out she had an AirTag or tracker of sorts somewhere. She checks his location religiously and will leave at all hours of the day to follow him if she thinks he is going to meet another woman.

The reason I’m asking if I’m the asshole is because me and my mom recently got into an argument. I’ve had a strained relationship with her since she found out I was gay about a year ago but we are civil and just don’t talk about it. This argument started because she was questioning me about my relationship with my girlfriend(18f) and trying to tell me that she wasn’t good for me. I was annoyed with her because I try not to talk about my girlfriend around her to avoid the conflict. When she brought it up I responded without thinking and said “I don’t think you should be giving out relationship advice.” She immediately started crying and saying it wasn’t her fault and I shouldn’t hold that over her. I left the room but later we were watching TV and she reignited the issue by venting to me about dad and kept mentioning how he would probably marry “some whore” and just fully shit talking my dad to me and saying how horrible he was to her. I know she’s upset but I wish she wouldn’t vent to me about this situation because I still love my dad and would rather not be involved. I tried to just switch the topic but she doubled down so I said “it doesn’t really matter who he marries.” This upset her and she accused me of not caring at all that they split and then told me I was just like him and didn’t have any emotions. At this point I was angry with her and I said I would rather be like my dad than her and I could understand why dad would want to be with someone else.

Now she is accusing me of siding with my dad and excusing his actions. ",AmItheAsshole,Educational_Slice658,596,0.78,537,2025-04-13 23:28:20+00:00,Everyone Sucks,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1jyl1xn/aita_for_siding_with_my_dad_in_the_divorce_even/,True,Everyone Sucks
1jyelws,"AITA for not giving our dog back to my ex after our breakup, even though I said I would?","Eight months ago, my ex (30F) broke up with me (32M) after a year and a half together. During the relationship, we bought an apartment and adopted a stray puppy—Doggy—who became incredibly important to me, especially after I went through a period of severe depression and anxiety triggered by workplace harassment. Both my ex and Doggy played a vital role in my recovery. I even considered registering him as an emotional support animal but backed out, not wanting to change his playful nature through training.

After we split, we agreed she would stay in the apartment while I found another place, and that we’d share custody of Doggy, alternating every two weeks. Meanwhile, we’d figure out what to do with the apartment (sell, rent, etc.). The apartment had issues—it needed renovations we never finished and was facing partial expropriation—so selling it seemed like a long, complicated process. She initially offered to buy my share but backed out when I asked how much she’d pay. Later, she proposed buying my part for two-thirds of the original value, despite us having invested more money in it for repairs.

Two months ago, I went to collect some things, and she pressed me for an answer about the apartment. I said I needed more time because her offer was too low. That’s when she told me she didn’t want to share custody of Doggy anymore. I said if that was the case, we’d have to settle it legally. On the day she was supposed to hand him over, she told me she wouldn’t—that I had “threatened” her and that Doggy was hers all along, and she’d only “loaned” him to me. I had a panic attack. I was devastated.

Later, since I had made a counteroffer on the apartment (asking for just the cost plus what I’d spent on improvements), she accepted. I told her how much her actions were hurting me. She agreed to let me have Doggy one last time—under the condition that it would truly be the last time. I didn’t want to accept, but I felt I had no choice.

She kept her word and gave me Doggy. I followed through on the apartment sale. But in the month I spent with Doggy, I realized how deep my bond with him is. I didn’t feel it was fair to be forced to give him up completely. The day before I was supposed to return him (two days ago), I texted her saying I didn’t agree with how things were handled and asked to talk things through so we could reach a mutual agreement. She was furious and reminded me I had promised to give him back and that this was meant to be the final time.

I truly meant to return Doggy, but when the moment came, I couldn’t do it. The anxiety of possibly never seeing him again overwhelmed me. Still, I offered a compromise: she could keep Doggy, but we’d share custody until the end of the year so I could gradually detach from him. I sent that message yesterday, and she hasn’t replied yet. I do feel guilty for not keeping my word, but I honestly didn’t know what else to do.

1jy8678,AITA for calling TOP bad music?,"
So for context me and my ex had recently reconnected to apologise for our past relationship in 2023 in which was constant on and off and arguing. So anyways fast foreword to Thursday, I had been replying to a reel he had sent stating “no today” in which he replied “is that a twenty one pilots reference?” I laughed and said, “Hell no, I don’t listen to white people music.” It was clearly a joke—we’ve always teased each other like that. I’m mixed and he’s white and ginger, and we’ve had a long history of joking back and forth about stuff like that without taking it seriously.

But like usual it turned into an heated argument. He started going off about how I was being close-minded and unfair, and began listing artists I like as if he was trying to catch me in a contradiction. I told him that I respect that Twenty One Pilots helped him through hard times, but I just personally don’t enjoy their music—and that’s not a crime.

He didn’t take that well. He started mocking my music taste (which he’s done before), and when I stood up for myself, he completely derailed the conversation and started attacking me—bringing up my past, stuff I’ve done with other guys, and basically called me a whore. All because I don’t like his favorite band??
